```typescript
import { provideWorkspaceAndFacilities } from '@headlessly/provide-workspace-and-facilities'

const workspace = provideWorkspaceAndFacilities()

// Acquire workspace for new team
const ws = await workspace.acquireWorkspace({
  building: 'HQ-West',
  floor: 4,
  seats: 25,
  equipment: ['standing-desks', 'monitors', 'phones']
})

// Check available workspaces
const available = await workspace.findAvailableWorkspaces({
  building: 'HQ-West',
  type: 'open-plan',
  minSeats: 10
})
```
