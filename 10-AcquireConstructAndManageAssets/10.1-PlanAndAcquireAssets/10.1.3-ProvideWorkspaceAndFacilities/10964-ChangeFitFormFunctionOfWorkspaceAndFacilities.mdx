# Change fit/form/function of workspace and facilities

> Business-as-Code definition for workspace and facility reconfiguration. Models the complete process of assessing, planning, and executing changes to workspace layout, form, and function.

## Overview

Modifying the formation of the workspace and its assets. Make necessary changes in an office space with all assets (tables, chairs, computers, admin staff, interior designing, etc.) according to requirements.

  actor: FacilitiesManager
  result: ReconfiguredWorkspace
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessCurrentLayout | Evaluate the existing workspace configuration against new requirements |
| developReconfigurationPlan | Create a detailed plan for workspace modifications including timelines and costs |
| coordinateContractors | Engage and manage interior designers, construction teams, and IT installers |
| executeFitOut | Perform physical modifications to workspace layout, furniture, and infrastructure |
| validateCompliance | Confirm that reconfigured space meets building codes, safety, and accessibility standards |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| layoutAssessed | Current workspace assessment completed with gap analysis |
| reconfigurationPlanApproved | Modification plan reviewed and approved by stakeholders |
| contractorsEngaged | External vendors and contractors confirmed and scheduled |
| fitOutCompleted | Physical workspace modifications finished |
| complianceValidated | Reconfigured space passed all regulatory and safety inspections |

## Usage

```typescript
import { changeFitFormFunction } from '@headlessly/change-fit-form-function-of-workspace-and-facilities'

const workspace = changeFitFormFunction()

// Assess current workspace layout
const assessment = await workspace.assessCurrentLayout({
  workspaceId: 'floor-3-east',
  requirements: ['open-plan', 'collaboration-zones', 'quiet-rooms']
})

// Develop reconfiguration plan
const plan = await workspace.developReconfigurationPlan({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  budget: 250000,
  targetCompletionDate: '2026-06-01'
})
```
