# Design facility

> Business-as-Code definition for developing architectural and engineering designs for new or renovated facilities that meet operational, safety, and regulatory requirements.

## Overview

Preparing and analyzing different designs for a facility in order to finalize which design will be the most suitable option.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| gatherDesignRequirements | Collect functional, operational, and regulatory requirements from stakeholders |
| developConceptualDesign | Create preliminary layout and design concepts for evaluation |
| evaluateDesignAlternatives | Compare multiple design options against requirements and constraints |
| conductFeasibilityStudy | Assess technical and financial viability of proposed designs |
| finalizeDesignSpecifications | Lock in detailed architectural and engineering specifications |
| obtainDesignApproval | Present final design for stakeholder and regulatory approval |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| designRequirementsGathered | All stakeholder requirements collected and documented |
| conceptualDesignDeveloped | Preliminary design concepts created and presented |

## Usage

```typescript
import { designFacility } from '@headlessly/design-facility'

const design = designFacility()

// Gather design requirements from stakeholders
const requirements = await design.gatherDesignRequirements({
  facilityType: 'distribution-center',
  stakeholders: ['Operations', 'Safety', 'IT'],
  targetCapacity: 500000
})

// Evaluate design alternatives
const alternatives = await design.evaluateDesignAlternatives({
  requirementSetId: requirements.id,
  maxOptions: 3,
  criteria: ['cost', 'efficiency', 'expandability']
})

// Finalize specifications
const specs = await design.finalizeDesignSpecifications({
  selectedDesignId: alternatives.ranked[0].id,
  detailLevel: 'construction-ready'
})
```
