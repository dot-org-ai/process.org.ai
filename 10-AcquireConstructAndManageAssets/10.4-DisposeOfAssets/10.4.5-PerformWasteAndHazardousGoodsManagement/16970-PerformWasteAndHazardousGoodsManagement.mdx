| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| 10.4.2 Decommission productive assets | Upstream - decommissioning generates hazardous waste requiring disposal |
| 10.4.4 Perform abandonment | Parallel - abandoned sites may contain waste requiring management |
| 10.4.1 Develop exit strategy | Upstream - exit strategy identifies waste management obligations |

```typescript
import { performWasteAndHazardousGoodsManagement } from '@headlessly/perform-waste-and-hazardous-goods-management'

const waste = performWasteAndHazardousGoodsManagement()

// Classify waste streams from a decommissioned asset
const classification = await waste.classifyWasteStreams({
  sourceAssetId: 'chemical-storage-tank-4',
  materials: ['residual-solvents', 'tank-sludge', 'contaminated-piping'],
  regulatoryFramework: 'RCRA'
})

// Transport waste to licensed disposal facility
