## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyAssetsForDisposal | Determine which assets are candidates for disposal based on condition, utilization, and lifecycle stage |
| evaluateDisposalOptions | Analyze available disposition methods including sale, trade, donation, recycling, or abandonment |
| assessFinancialImplications | Calculate book value, tax implications, removal costs, and potential recovery value |
| determineEnvironmentalObligations | Identify environmental remediation, hazardous material, and regulatory requirements |
| formalizeExitPlan | Document the approved disposal approach, timeline, and responsible parties |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| disposalCandidatesIdentified | Assets recommended for disposal cataloged |
| disposalOptionsEvaluated | Disposition methods compared and optimal approach selected |
| financialImplicationsAssessed | Tax, book value, and cost recovery analysis completed |
| environmentalObligationsDetermined | Environmental and regulatory requirements documented |
| exitPlanFormalized | Approved exit strategy document published |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findDisposalCandidates | List assets recommended for disposal by condition, age, or utilization |
| getExitPlan | Retrieve the exit strategy for a specific asset or asset group |
| getDisposalOptions | Retrieve available disposition methods and their financial implications |
| findEnvironmentalObligations | List environmental requirements for asset disposal by type or location |

| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| 10.4.2 Decommission productive assets | Downstream - exit plan triggers decommissioning |
| 10.4.3 Perform sale or trade | Downstream - sale/trade is one disposal option |
| 10.3.1.2 Analyze assets and predict maintenance requirements | Upstream - asset analysis informs disposal decisions |

## Usage

```typescript
import { developExitStrategy } from '@headlessly/develop-exit-strategy'

const strategy = developExitStrategy()

// Identify assets for disposal
const candidates = await strategy.identifyAssetsForDisposal({
  criteria: {
    remainingUsefulLife: { lessThan: 2 },
    utilizationRate: { lessThan: 0.30 },
    maintenanceCostRatio: { greaterThan: 0.15 }
  },
  facilityId: 'plant-north'
})

// Evaluate disposal options
const options = await strategy.evaluateDisposalOptions({
  assetIds: candidates.map(a => a.id),
  methods: ['sale', 'trade-in', 'recycling', 'abandonment']
})
```
