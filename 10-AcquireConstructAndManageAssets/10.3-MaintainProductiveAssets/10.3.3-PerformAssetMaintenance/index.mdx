# Perform asset maintenance

> Business-as-Code definition for executing preventive, routine, corrective, and unplanned maintenance activities on productive assets to restore or sustain operational capability and reliability.

## Overview

Engaging in all aspects of asset maintenance. Ensure that all assets are functioning properly and to all specified codes and regulations where applicable. Maintenance includes all preventative, routine, and corrective activates.
