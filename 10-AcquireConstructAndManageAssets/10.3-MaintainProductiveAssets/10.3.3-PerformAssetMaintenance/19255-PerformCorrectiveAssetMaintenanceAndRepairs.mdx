# Perform corrective asset maintenance and repairs

> Business-as-Code definition for corrective maintenance and repair execution. Models the complete process of diagnosing, repairing, and restoring assets that have experienced known faults, breakdowns, or degraded performance.

## Overview

Repairing or correcting faults that occur with an asset. This could be a break or other repairable damage.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| diagnoseFault | Investigate the reported failure to determine the root cause and scope of repair |
| planRepairApproach | Define the repair method, parts needed, and estimated duration |
| executeRepair | Perform the physical repair including component replacement, adjustment, or rebuilding |
| testRepairedAsset | Run functional tests to verify the repair resolved the fault |
| conductRootCauseAnalysis | Analyze the failure to identify underlying causes and prevent recurrence |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| faultDiagnosed | Root cause of the failure identified and repair scope determined |
| repairPlanned | Repair approach, parts, and timeline defined |
| repairExecuted | Physical repair work completed |
| repairedAssetTested | Functional tests confirmed the repair resolved the fault |
| rootCauseAnalysisCompleted | Failure analysis documented with prevention recommendations |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findOpenRepairOrders | List active corrective maintenance work orders by priority or asset |
| getRepairHistory | Retrieve the repair history for a specific asset |
| findRecurringFailures | List assets with repeated failures of the same type |
| getRootCauseAnalysis | Retrieve the failure analysis for a specific repair event |

## Usage

```typescript
import { performCorrectiveAssetMaintenanceAndRepairs } from '@headlessly/perform-corrective-asset-maintenance-and-repairs'

const repair = performCorrectiveAssetMaintenanceAndRepairs()

// Diagnose the fault
const diagnosis = await repair.diagnoseFault({
  workOrderId: 'cm-2026-0567',
  assetId: 'compressor-205',
  symptoms: ['excessive-vibration', 'abnormal-noise', 'reduced-output']
})

// Execute the repair
const result = await repair.executeRepair({
  workOrderId: 'cm-2026-0567',
  diagnosis: diagnosis.rootCause,
  repairPlan: 'replace-bearings-and-realign'
})
