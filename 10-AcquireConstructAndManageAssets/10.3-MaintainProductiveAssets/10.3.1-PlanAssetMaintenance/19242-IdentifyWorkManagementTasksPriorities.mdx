# Identify work management tasks & priorities

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance work task identification and prioritization. Models the complete process of cataloging maintenance tasks, assessing urgency, and establishing priority rankings.

## Overview

Identifying the steps needed for asset maintenance. List out the those tasks that are involved in completing this process. Prioritize the tasks that are created.

## Process Hierarchy

    A[Plan asset maintenance] --> B[Develop maintenance strategies]
    A --> C[Identify work management tasks and priorities]
    A --> D[Conduct resource planning]
    A --> E[Create work plans]
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: Work Management Tasks & Priorities
  actor: MaintenancePlanner
  result: PrioritizedTaskList
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| catalogMaintenanceTasks | Enumerate all maintenance activities required for each asset class |
| assessTaskUrgency | Evaluate the time-sensitivity and operational impact of each maintenance task |
| rankTaskPriority | Assign priority levels based on criticality, safety impact, and resource constraints |
| allocateTasksToSchedule | Place prioritized tasks into the maintenance schedule backlog |
| reviewBacklogPriorities | Periodically reassess task priorities based on changing conditions |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| tasksCataloged | Comprehensive maintenance task list created for asset classes |
| urgencyAssessed | Task urgency evaluations completed |
| prioritiesRanked | Tasks assigned priority levels and sequenced |
| tasksAllocated | Prioritized tasks placed into the scheduling backlog |
| backlogReviewed | Task priorities reassessed and updated |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findTasksByPriority | List maintenance tasks filtered by priority level |
| getTaskBacklog | Retrieve the current maintenance task backlog for a facility |
| findOverdueTasks | List tasks that have exceeded their planned execution date |
| getTaskDependencies | Retrieve prerequisite tasks or dependencies for a specific maintenance task |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyWorkManagementTasksPriorities } from '@headlessly/identify-work-management-tasks-and-priorities'

const tasks = identifyWorkManagementTasksPriorities()

// Catalog all maintenance tasks for a facility
const catalog = await tasks.catalogMaintenanceTasks({
  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  assetClasses: ['pumps', 'compressors', 'heat-exchangers'],
  source: 'manufacturer-recommendations'
})

// Rank tasks by priority
const prioritized = await tasks.rankTaskPriority({
  taskListId: catalog.id,
  criteria: ['safety-impact', 'production-impact', 'regulatory-requirement'],
  method: 'weighted-scoring'
})
```
