# Integrate preventive maintenance into operations schedule

> Business-as-Code definition for preventive maintenance scheduling integration. Models the complete process of coordinating planned maintenance windows with production schedules to minimize operational disruption.

## Overview

Devising a methodology and procedure for assimilating the works of planned maintenance into the schedule scheme for the processing of finished products that utilizes the same machinery.

  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  assets: ['production-line-1', 'production-line-2'],
  planningHorizon: '3-months'
})

// Align with production schedule
const aligned = await integration.alignWithProductionSchedule({
  maintenanceWindows: windows.id,
  productionScheduleId: 'q2-2026-production',
  priority: 'minimize-downtime'
})
