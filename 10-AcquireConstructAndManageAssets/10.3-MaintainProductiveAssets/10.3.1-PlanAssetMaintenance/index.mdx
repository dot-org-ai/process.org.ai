# Plan asset maintenance

> Business-as-Code definition for developing maintenance strategies, analyzing asset condition, specifying maintenance policies, and creating work plans to ensure productive assets remain reliable and cost-effective.

## Overview

Ensuring that necessary resources are available and tasks are prioritized accordingly through planning. Provide strategies and policies that identify tasks that need to be completed, and the resources necessary to fulfill those tasks.
