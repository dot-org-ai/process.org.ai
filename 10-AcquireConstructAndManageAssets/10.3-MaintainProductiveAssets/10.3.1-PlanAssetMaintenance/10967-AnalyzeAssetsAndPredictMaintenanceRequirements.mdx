# Analyze assets and predict maintenance requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for predictive asset analysis. Models the complete process of evaluating asset condition data, applying predictive analytics, and forecasting future maintenance requirements.

## Overview

Evaluating assets in order to project future requirements for maintenance. Evaluate the present working condition of assets. Determine the future maintenance requirements of assets.
