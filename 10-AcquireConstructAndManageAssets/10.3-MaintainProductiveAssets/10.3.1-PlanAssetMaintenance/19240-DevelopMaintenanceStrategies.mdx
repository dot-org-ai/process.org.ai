# Develop maintenance strategies

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance strategy development. Models the complete process of defining reliability-centered approaches, maintenance philosophies, and long-term asset care strategies.

## Overview

Creating goals and agendas to better realize the success of the maintenance policies that have been put into place.

## Usage

```typescript
import { developMaintenanceStrategies } from '@headlessly/develop-maintenance-strategies'

const strategy = developMaintenanceStrategies()

// Assess asset criticality across the plant
const criticality = await strategy.assessAssetCriticality({
  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  assetClasses: ['rotating-equipment', 'electrical-systems', 'instrumentation'],
  riskMatrix: 'consequence-likelihood'
})

// Select maintenance approach per asset class
const approaches = await strategy.selectMaintenanceApproach({
  criticalityResults: criticality.id,
  options: ['preventive', 'predictive', 'condition-based', 'run-to-failure']
})
```
