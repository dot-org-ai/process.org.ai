# Conduct resource planning

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance resource planning. Models the complete process of forecasting, budgeting, and allocating labor, materials, and tools required for asset maintenance activities.

## Overview

Analyzing workload needs in relation to asset maintenance and plan resources around those needs.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| forecastLaborDemand | Estimate maintenance labor hours by trade, skill level, and time period |
| planSparePartsInventory | Determine spare parts and consumables needed to support planned maintenance |
| budgetMaintenanceResources | Develop cost estimates for labor, materials, tools, and contracted services |
| allocateResources | Assign available labor, materials, and equipment to scheduled maintenance tasks |
| identifyResourceGaps | Detect shortfalls between resource demand and availability |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| laborDemandForecasted | Maintenance labor requirements estimated by trade and period |
| sparePartsPlanned | Spare parts and consumables requirements identified |
| resourcesBudgeted | Maintenance resource budget compiled and submitted |
| resourcesAllocated | Labor and materials assigned to maintenance tasks |
| resourceGapsIdentified | Shortfalls between demand and capacity documented |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getResourcePlan | Retrieve the resource allocation plan for a facility or period |
| findSparePartsNeeds | List spare parts requirements by asset or maintenance task |

## Usage

```typescript
import { conductResourcePlanning } from '@headlessly/conduct-resource-planning'

const planning = conductResourcePlanning()

// Forecast labor demand for the quarter
const forecast = await planning.forecastLaborDemand({
  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  period: 'Q2-2026',
  trades: ['mechanical', 'electrical', 'instrumentation']
})

// Plan spare parts inventory
const parts = await planning.planSparePartsInventory({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  leadTimeBuffer: 14,
  safetyStockLevel: 'standard'
})
