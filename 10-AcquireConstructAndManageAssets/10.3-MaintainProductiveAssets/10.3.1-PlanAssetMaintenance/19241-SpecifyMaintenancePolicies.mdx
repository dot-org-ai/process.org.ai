# Specify maintenance policies

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance policy specification. Models the complete process of defining, documenting, and communicating standardized maintenance policies, procedures, and service levels.

## Overview

Communicating policies in regards to asset maintenance. Provide a clear set of procedures and policies that outline what will be involved in the maintenance process.

## GraphDL

```yaml
specify:
  object: Maintenance Policies
  actor: MaintenanceManager
  result: MaintenancePolicyDocument
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| draftMaintenancePolicies | Write maintenance policies covering scope, responsibilities, and procedures |
| defineServiceLevels | Establish response times, resolution targets, and escalation paths for maintenance requests |
| documentStandardProcedures | Create step-by-step maintenance procedures for each asset class |
| obtainPolicyApproval | Route policies through management review and approval |
| communicatePolicies | Distribute approved policies to maintenance staff, operations, and contractors |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| policiesDrafted | Maintenance policy documents created for review |
| serviceLevelsDefined | Response and resolution targets established |
| proceduresDocumented | Standard maintenance procedures compiled |
| policiesApproved | Management formally approved maintenance policies |
| policiesCommunicated | Approved policies distributed to all stakeholders |

## Searches

  assetClasses: ['rotating-equipment', 'electrical', 'instrumentation'],
  complianceFramework: 'ISO-55001'
})

// Define service levels
const sla = await policies.defineServiceLevels({
  policyId: draft.id,
  criticalResponseTime: '2h',
  routineResponseTime: '24h',
  emergencyResponseTime: '30m'
})
