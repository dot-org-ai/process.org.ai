# Update work and asset records

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance record updates. Models the complete process of recording completed maintenance activities, updating asset condition data, and maintaining work history in enterprise systems.

## Overview

Modifying existing maintenance records to include all new work that has been performed, what assets were serviced, and any issues that might have arisen.

## GraphDL

```yaml
update:
  object: Work And Asset Records
  actor: MaintenanceTechnician
  result: UpdatedAssetRecord
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| closeWorkOrders | Document task completion details including labor hours, parts used, and findings |
| updateAssetCondition | Record current asset condition, readings, and any observed anomalies |
| logFailureModes | Document failure modes, root causes, and corrective actions taken |
| updateMaintenanceHistory | Add completed maintenance activities to the asset history log |
| reconcileInventory | Adjust spare parts inventory to reflect materials consumed during maintenance |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| workOrderClosed | Maintenance task completion details recorded |
| assetConditionUpdated | Current asset condition data entered into the system |
| failureModesLogged | Failure analysis data documented |
| maintenanceHistoryUpdated | Asset maintenance log updated with completed activities |
| inventoryReconciled | Spare parts inventory adjusted for consumed materials |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getAssetMaintenanceHistory | Retrieve the complete maintenance history for a specific asset |
| findRecentWorkOrders | List recently closed work orders by date, asset, or technician |
| getFailureModeData | Retrieve failure mode and root cause data for an asset or asset class |
| getInventoryAdjustments | Retrieve spare parts consumption data for a given period |

## Usage

```typescript
import { updateWorkAndAssetRecords } from '@headlessly/update-work-and-asset-records'

const records = updateWorkAndAssetRecords()

// Close a completed work order
const closure = await records.closeWorkOrders({
  workOrderId: 'wo-2026-1234',
  laborHours: 4.5,
  partsUsed: ['bearing-6205', 'mechanical-seal-type-a'],
  findings: 'Bearing showed excessive wear on inner race'
})

// Update asset condition
const condition = await records.updateAssetCondition({
  assetId: 'pump-101',
  readings: { vibration: 2.1, temperature: 65, pressure: 145 },
  overallCondition: 'good'
})
```
