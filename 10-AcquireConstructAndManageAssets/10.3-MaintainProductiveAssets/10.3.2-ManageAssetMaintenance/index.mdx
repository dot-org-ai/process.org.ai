# Manage asset maintenance

> Business-as-Code definition for scheduling maintenance work, obtaining resources, enforcing quality control and safety standards, and monitoring maintenance performance against defined targets and service contracts.

## Overview

Ensuring that asset maintenance is conducted in a timely manner and successfully. Schedule work with the required resources with an eye on quality control and safety. Verify that contracted maintenance meets performance targets.
