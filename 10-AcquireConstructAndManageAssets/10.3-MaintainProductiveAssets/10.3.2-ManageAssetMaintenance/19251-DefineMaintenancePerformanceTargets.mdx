# Define maintenance performance targets

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance performance target setting. Models the complete process of establishing measurable performance objectives, benchmarks, and key indicators for maintenance operations.

## Overview

Outlining what should be achieved through predictive indicators with regard to performing maintenance. This could include the length of time it takes to perform routine maintenance or how often unplanned maintenance feasibly occur.

## Process Hierarchy

    A[Manage asset maintenance] --> B[Manage maintenance work safety]
    A --> C[Define maintenance performance targets]
    A --> D[Monitor maintenance performance against targets/contracts]
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: Maintenance Performance Targets
  actor: MaintenanceManager
  result: PerformanceTargetDocument
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyKeyMetrics | Select the KPIs that best measure maintenance effectiveness and efficiency |
| setBaselineValues | Establish current performance levels from historical data as a starting point |
| defineTargetLevels | Set achievable but challenging performance targets for each metric |
| alignWithBusinessObjectives | Ensure maintenance targets support overall operational and financial goals |
| publishTargets | Communicate approved performance targets to maintenance teams and stakeholders |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| keyMetricsIdentified | Performance metrics selected for the maintenance program |
| baselinesEstablished | Current performance levels documented from historical data |
| targetLevelsDefined | Specific performance targets set for each metric |
| targetsAligned | Maintenance targets confirmed to support business objectives |
| targetsPublished | Approved targets distributed to all maintenance stakeholders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getPerformanceTargets | Retrieve the current performance targets for a facility or asset class |
| getBaselineData | Retrieve historical performance data used to set baselines |
| findTargetGaps | Identify metrics where current performance falls short of targets |
| getBenchmarkComparisons | Retrieve industry benchmark data for comparison |

| Baseline Data Quality | Percentage of metrics with statistically valid baseline data | % |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineMaintenancePerformanceTargets } from '@headlessly/define-maintenance-performance-targets'

const targets = defineMaintenancePerformanceTargets()

// Identify key metrics for the maintenance program
const metrics = await targets.identifyKeyMetrics({
  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  categories: ['availability', 'cost', 'safety', 'quality'],
  framework: 'ISO-55001'
})

// Define target levels
const levels = await targets.defineTargetLevels({
  metricsId: metrics.id,
  targets: {
    overallEquipmentEffectiveness: 0.85,
    plannedMaintenancePercentage: 0.80,
    meanTimeBetweenFailures: 720,
    maintenanceCostPerRAV: 0.03
  }
})
