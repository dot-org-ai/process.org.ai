# Monitor maintenance performance against targets/contracts

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance performance monitoring. Models the complete process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on maintenance KPIs against established targets and contractual obligations.

## Overview

Following set performance targets, monitor and gage the success of the organization in meeting those targets.

## GraphDL

```yaml
monitor:
  object: Maintenance Performance Against Targets/contracts
  actor: MaintenanceAnalyst
  result: PerformanceDashboard
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| collectPerformanceData | Aggregate maintenance KPI data from work orders, asset records, and financial systems |
| analyzePerformanceTrends | Identify trends, patterns, and deviations in maintenance performance metrics |
| compareAgainstTargets | Evaluate actual performance against established targets and contractual SLAs |
| generatePerformanceReports | Produce periodic dashboards and reports for management review |
| recommendImprovements | Propose corrective actions for areas where performance falls below targets |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| performanceDataCollected | KPI data aggregated from enterprise systems for the reporting period |
| trendsAnalyzed | Performance trend analysis completed |
| targetVarianceDetected | Actual performance deviating from targets or SLAs identified |
| performanceReportGenerated | Periodic performance report published |
| improvementsRecommended | Corrective action recommendations submitted |

import { monitorMaintenancePerformanceAgainstTargetsContracts } from '@headlessly/monitor-maintenance-performance-against-targets-contracts'

const monitor = monitorMaintenancePerformanceAgainstTargetsContracts()

// Collect performance data for the period
const data = await monitor.collectPerformanceData({
  facilityId: 'plant-north',
  period: 'Q1-2026',
  metrics: ['OEE', 'MTBF', 'MTTR', 'planned-maintenance-percentage']
})

// Compare against targets
const comparison = await monitor.compareAgainstTargets({
  dataId: data.id,
  targetSetId: 'targets-2026',
  includeContractSLAs: true
})
```
