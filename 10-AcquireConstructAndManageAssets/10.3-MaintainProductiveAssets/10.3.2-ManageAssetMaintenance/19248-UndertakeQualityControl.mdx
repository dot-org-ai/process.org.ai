# Undertake quality control

> Business-as-Code definition for maintenance quality control. Models the complete process of verifying, inspecting, and validating that completed maintenance work meets quality standards and specifications.

## Overview

Implementing a checks and balances system to verify that the maintenance was performed correctly. Rework when errors are found.

## GraphDL

```yaml
undertake:
  object: Quality Control
  actor: QualityInspector
  result: QualityVerificationReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| inspectCompletedWork | Verify that maintenance tasks were performed according to work plan specifications |
| testAssetPerformance | Run functional and performance tests on maintained assets to confirm proper operation |
| documentFindings | Record inspection results, test data, and any deviations from standards |
| initiateRework | Generate rework orders for maintenance tasks that failed quality inspection |
| signOffCompletion | Formally approve completed maintenance work that passes quality checks |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| workInspected | Post-maintenance inspection completed |
| performanceTested | Asset functional and performance tests executed |
| findingsDocumented | Quality inspection findings recorded |
| reworkInitiated | Rework order generated for deficient maintenance work |
| completionSignedOff | Maintenance work formally approved and closed |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findPendingInspections | List completed work orders awaiting quality inspection |
| getInspectionResults | Retrieve quality inspection findings for a specific work order |
| findReworkOrders | List active rework orders by priority or trade |
| getQualityTrends | Retrieve quality pass/fail trends over time |

## Usage

```typescript
import { undertakeQualityControl } from '@headlessly/undertake-quality-control'

const qc = undertakeQualityControl()

// Inspect completed maintenance work
const inspection = await qc.inspectCompletedWork({
  workOrderId: 'wo-2026-1234',
  checkpoints: ['torque-verification', 'alignment-check', 'leak-test']
})

// Sign off on quality-verified work
const signoff = await qc.signOffCompletion({
  workOrderId: 'wo-2026-1234',
  inspectionId: inspection.id,
  approver: 'maintenance-supervisor-north'
})
```
