# Maintain productive assets

> Business-as-Code definition for preserving productive assets through planning, scheduling, and executing preventive, routine, corrective, and unplanned maintenance work to maximize asset availability and useful life.

## Overview

Preserving productive assets through the planning, managing, and performance of preventative, routine, and critical maintenance work.

## Usage

```typescript
import { maintainProductiveAssets } from '@headlessly/maintain-productive-assets'

const maintenance = maintainProductiveAssets()

// Plan maintenance work for next quarter
const workPlan = await maintenance.planMaintenanceWork({
  facility: 'Plant-A',
  period: '2025-Q2',
  includePreventive: true,
  includePredictive: true
})

// Check asset health status
const health = await maintenance.getAssetHealth({
  assetId: 'CNC-MILL-003',
  includeHistory: true,
  predictFailure: true
})

// Execute corrective maintenance
const repair = await maintenance.executeCorrectiveMaintenance({
  workOrderId: 'WO-2025-1847',
  failureMode: 'bearing-wear',
  priority: 'urgent'
})
```
