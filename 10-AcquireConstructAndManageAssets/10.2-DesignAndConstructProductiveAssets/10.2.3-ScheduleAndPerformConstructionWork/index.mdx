# Schedule and perform construction work

> Business-as-Code definition for scheduling construction timelines, obtaining resources, and executing the physical construction, augmentation, or replacement of productive assets.

## Overview

Arranging a timetable for which to perform construction work. Schedule resources to contract assets for new or replacement assets. Reschedule or redesign assets if needed.

```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| scheduleConstructionWork | Define construction timeline with milestones and dependencies |
| obtainResources | Procure labor, materials, equipment, and contractor services |
| constructNewAssets | Execute physical construction of new productive assets |
| augmentExistingAssets | Modify or expand existing assets to meet changing requirements |
| renewReplaceAssets | Replace worn or obsolete assets with new equivalents |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| constructionWorkScheduled | Construction timeline and milestones finalized |
| resourcesObtained | Labor, materials, and equipment procured for construction |
| newAssetsConstructed | New productive asset construction completed |
| existingAssetsAugmented | Existing asset modification or expansion completed |
| assetsRenewedReplaced | Asset replacement or renewal work completed |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getConstructionSchedule | Retrieve construction timeline with milestones and progress |
| findResourceAvailability | Check availability of labor, materials, and equipment |
| getConstructionProgress | Query completion percentage and upcoming milestones |

## Usage

```typescript
import { scheduleAndPerformConstructionWork } from '@headlessly/schedule-and-perform-construction-work'

const construction = scheduleAndPerformConstructionWork()

// Schedule construction work
const schedule = await construction.scheduleConstructionWork({
  projectId: 'CAP-2025-042',
  startDate: '2025-06-01',
  milestones: ['foundation', 'framing', 'mechanical', 'finish']
})

// Track construction progress
const progress = await construction.getConstructionProgress({
  projectId: 'CAP-2025-042',
  asOfDate: '2025-08-15'
})
```
