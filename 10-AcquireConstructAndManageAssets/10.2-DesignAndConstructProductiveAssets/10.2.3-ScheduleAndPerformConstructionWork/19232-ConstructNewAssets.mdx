# Construct new assets

> Business-as-Code definition for new asset construction. Models the complete process of executing the physical build of new productive assets from ground-breaking through commissioning.

## Overview

Building new assets necessary for the organization. Be aware of any construction codes and permits that need to be addressed.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| prepareSite | Clear, grade, and prepare the construction site including temporary facilities |
| executeFoundationWork | Construct foundations, footings, and below-grade infrastructure |
| erectStructure | Build the primary structural framework including steel, concrete, or masonry |
| installSystems | Install mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and specialty systems |
| commissionAsset | Test, verify, and hand over the completed asset for operational use |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| sitePrepared | Construction site cleared, graded, and ready for foundation work |
| foundationCompleted | Foundations and below-grade work finished and inspected |
| structureErected | Primary structural framework completed |
| systemsInstalled | All mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems installed |
| assetCommissioned | Asset tested, verified, and accepted for operations |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getConstructionStatus | Retrieve the current phase and completion percentage of a new build |
| findActiveWorkOrders | List open work orders by trade, phase, or priority |
| getInspectionResults | Retrieve inspection outcomes for a specific construction phase |
| findPunchListItems | List outstanding deficiencies requiring correction before handover |

## Usage

```typescript
import { constructNewAssets } from '@headlessly/construct-new-assets'

const construction = constructNewAssets()

// Prepare the construction site
const site = await construction.prepareSite({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  siteId: 'lot-42-industrial-park',
  activities: ['clearing', 'grading', 'temporary-facilities']
})

// Commission the completed asset
const commissioning = await construction.commissionAsset({
  assetId: site.assetId,
  testProtocol: 'full-systems-validation',
  acceptanceCriteria: 'operational-readiness'
})
```
