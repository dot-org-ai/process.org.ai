# Develop construction strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for construction strategy development. Models the complete process of defining the approach, methodology, and governance framework for constructing productive assets.

## Overview

Developing a strategy to perform asset construction. Assure that timelines, regulations, and resources are on task and on budget.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineConstructionApproach | Select build methodology such as design-build, design-bid-build, or EPC |
| establishGovernanceFramework | Define decision-making authority, approval gates, and escalation paths |
| assessRegulatoryRequirements | Identify all applicable building codes, environmental regulations, and safety standards |
| setTimelineAndBudgetTargets | Establish high-level schedule milestones and cost envelopes |
| selectContractingModel | Determine contracting strategy including lump-sum, cost-plus, or unit-price approaches |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| constructionApproachDefined | Build methodology selected and documented |
| governanceFrameworkEstablished | Decision authority and approval gates formalized |
| regulatoryRequirementsAssessed | Applicable regulations identified and cataloged |
| targetsSet | Timeline milestones and budget targets established |
| contractingModelSelected | Contracting approach finalized |

## Searches

| Search | Description |

const strategy = developConstructionStrategy()

// Define the construction approach
const approach = await strategy.defineConstructionApproach({

  methodology: 'design-build',
  complexity: 'high'
})

// Assess regulatory requirements
const regulations = await strategy.assessRegulatoryRequirements({
  jurisdiction: 'state-of-texas',
  projectType: 'industrial-facility',
  environmentalImpact: true
})
```
