# Perform construction performance management

> Business-as-Code definition for construction performance management. Models the complete process of measuring, analyzing, and optimizing construction activities against targets for schedule, cost, safety, and quality.

## Overview

Managing the construction process to ensure that activates are on task, on budget, and are being performed with safety and quality in mind.

  object: Construction Performance Management
  actor: ConstructionManager
  result: PerformanceReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| measureEarnedValue | Calculate earned value metrics including CPI and SPI for active construction |
| reviewSafetyPerformance | Assess safety incident rates, near-misses, and compliance with safety protocols |
| auditQualityStandards | Verify construction work meets design specifications and quality benchmarks |
| analyzeCostPerformance | Compare actual costs against budgeted amounts and forecast at completion |
| implementCorrectiveActions | Define and execute remediation plans for underperforming areas |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| earnedValueCalculated | CPI and SPI metrics updated for the reporting period |
| safetyPerformanceReviewed | Safety metrics and incident reports evaluated |
| qualityAuditCompleted | Quality inspection results documented |
| costOverrunDetected | Actual costs exceeding budget thresholds identified |
| correctiveActionImplemented | Remediation plan activated for a performance gap |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getPerformanceMetrics | Retrieve earned value and schedule performance data for a project |
| findSafetyIncidents | List safety incidents filtered by severity, date, or trade |
| getQualityAuditResults | Retrieve inspection results for a specific construction phase |
| findCorrectiveActions | List active corrective actions by project or category |

import { performConstructionPerformanceManagement } from '@headlessly/perform-construction-performance-management'

const performance = performConstructionPerformanceManagement()

// Measure earned value for the project
const ev = await performance.measureEarnedValue({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  reportingPeriod: 'week-22'
})

// Review safety performance
const safety = await performance.reviewSafetyPerformance({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  periodStart: '2026-01-01',
  periodEnd: '2026-03-31'
})
```
