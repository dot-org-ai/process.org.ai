# Design assets

> Business-as-Code definition for asset design. Models the complete process of developing architectural, structural, and engineering designs for productive assets that meet organizational and regulatory requirements.

## Overview

Designing assets to meet organizational needs as well as ensuring that the asset adheres to all national, regional, and local construction codes.

## Usage

```typescript
import { designAssets } from '@headlessly/design-assets'

const design = designAssets()

// Gather design requirements
const requirements = await design.gatherDesignRequirements({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  stakeholders: ['operations', 'safety', 'maintenance'],
  capacityTarget: '50000-units-per-month'
})

// Produce detailed engineering drawings
const drawings = await design.produceDetailedEngineering({
  conceptId: requirements.approvedConcept.id,
  standard: 'ASME',
  outputFormat: 'BIM'
})
```
