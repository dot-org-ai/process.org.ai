# Design and plan asset construction

> Business-as-Code definition for outlining construction strategies, obtaining regulatory permissions, designing productive assets, and planning resource requirements to ensure compliant and efficient asset construction.

## Overview

Outlining the steps and strategies needed to construct assets. Verify that all regulations are adhered to and that all permissions have been granted. Organize and plan for resources to complete construction.

```typescript
import { designAndPlanAssetConstruction } from '@headlessly/design-and-plan-asset-construction'

const design = designAndPlanAssetConstruction()

// Design a new production line
const specs = await design.designAssets({
  assetType: 'assembly-line',
  capacity: '500-units-per-day',
  compliance: ['OSHA', 'EPA', 'local-building-code']
})

// Check permit status
const permits = await design.findPermitStatus({
  projectId: 'CAP-2025-042',
  jurisdiction: 'Harris-County-TX'
})
