# Manage asset construction

> Business-as-Code definition for overseeing construction performance, quality control, record-keeping, and site safety to ensure productive assets are built to specification and in compliance with all standards.

## Overview

Overseeing the performance and quality of work. Assure that records are maintained throughout the construction process. Adhere to all safety, security, and access regulations set forth by the organization and all government standards.

import { manageAssetConstruction } from '@headlessly/manage-asset-construction'

const mgmt = manageAssetConstruction()

// Monitor construction work performance
const status = await mgmt.monitorWorkPerformance({
