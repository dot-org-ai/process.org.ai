# Monitor work performance

> Business-as-Code definition for construction work performance monitoring. Models the complete process of tracking, measuring, and reporting on construction activity progress, regulatory compliance, and quality standards.

## Overview

Monitoring construction to insure that all regulatory laws are being adhered to, that all work is being performed in a timely manner, and that quality assurance is met at all steps of the construction process.
