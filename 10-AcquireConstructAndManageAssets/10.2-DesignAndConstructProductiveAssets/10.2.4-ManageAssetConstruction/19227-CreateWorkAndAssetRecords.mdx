# Create work and asset records

> Business-as-Code definition for construction work and asset record creation. Models the complete process of documenting, cataloging, and archiving all construction activities, as-built conditions, and asset data.

## Overview

Implementing records to include all construction work that has been performed. Include all new or modified construction, and any construction or regulatory issues that might have occurred.

## GraphDL

```yaml
create:
  object: Work And Asset Records
  actor: DocumentController
  result: AssetRecordPackage
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| compileAsBuiltDocumentation | Gather final drawings, specifications, and field modifications into as-built records |
| recordWorkHistory | Document all construction activities, labor hours, and material usage |
| catalogAssetData | Register new or modified assets in the enterprise asset management system |
| archiveRegulatoryDocuments | Store permits, inspection reports, and compliance certificates |
| transferRecordsToOperations | Hand over complete asset documentation to the operations and maintenance teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| asBuiltDocumentationCompiled | Final as-built drawings and specifications assembled |
| workHistoryRecorded | Construction activity logs and resource records completed |
| assetDataCataloged | New assets registered in the enterprise asset management system |
| regulatoryDocumentsArchived | Permits and compliance records stored in the document management system |
| recordsTransferred | Complete documentation package delivered to operations |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

```typescript
import { createWorkAndAssetRecords } from '@headlessly/create-work-and-asset-records'

const records = createWorkAndAssetRecords()

// Compile as-built documentation
const asBuilt = await records.compileAsBuiltDocumentation({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  designRevision: 'v3-final',
  fieldModifications: true
})

// Catalog assets in the enterprise system
const catalog = await records.catalogAssetData({
  projectId: 'plant-expansion-north',
  assets: asBuilt.newAssets,
  eamSystem: 'maximo'
})
```
