# Design and construct productive assets

> Business-as-Code definition for conceptualizing, financing, designing, and building income-generating productive assets such as manufacturing plants, equipment, and infrastructure.

## Overview

Conceptualizing and realizing dividend and income generating assets such as machines, tools, factories, etc. Manage steps to acquire assets including managing capital, as well as planning, scheduling, and overseeing construction.

## Related Processes

| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| 10.1 Plan and acquire assets | Upstream - property acquisition precedes construction |
| 10.3 Maintain productive assets | Downstream - constructed assets enter maintenance lifecycle |
| 10.4 Dispose of assets | Downstream - assets eventually reach end of useful life |
| 8.0 Manage Financial Resources | Upstream - capital financing enables construction |

## Usage

```typescript
import { designAndConstructProductiveAssets } from '@headlessly/design-and-construct-productive-assets'

const construction = designAndConstructProductiveAssets()

// Define capital investment plan
const plan = await construction.defineCapitalPlan({
  assetType: 'manufacturing-line',
  estimatedCost: 15000000,
  targetCompletion: '2026-Q3'
})

// Monitor active construction project
const progress = await construction.monitorConstruction({
  projectId: 'CAP-2025-042',
  metrics: ['schedule-variance', 'cost-variance', 'safety-incidents']
})

// Commission completed asset
const commissioning = await construction.commissionAsset({
  projectId: 'CAP-2025-042',
  inspectionChecklist: 'standard-manufacturing',
  operationalReadiness: true
})
```
