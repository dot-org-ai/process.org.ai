# Manage flight crew preparations

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for manage flight crew preparations (airline)

## Overview

Scheduling crew for flight assignments. The crew provide bids for choosing their duty /off-duty period and these bids are factored in to create crew rosters.  Resource and reserve requirements are determined, and bid services / technology / other enablers are provided to submit bids. Thereafter, the crew bid process, which includes receiving bids for current and vacation schedules, is managed, crew accommodations booked and assignment plans produced.
