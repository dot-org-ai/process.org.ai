# Manage aircraft assignment and routing

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for manage aircraft assignment and routing (airline)

## Overview

Overseeing all aspects of assigning and routing aircraft. This entails assigning aircraft tail numbers to flight legs, which are origin-destination pairs with time/date of arrival/departure; evaluating maintenance requirements - e.g. whether and when a plane will be ready and available to fly, whether the maintenance department approved use of the aircraft for the flight - and turning over the assignment schedule / mapping of flights with tail numbers to SOC - systems operation control - the airline's control room.
