# Identify implications for key technology aspects

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying technology implications of strategic options. Models the assessment of technology ROI, architecture impact, capability gaps, and integration complexity for each strategic alternative under consideration.

## Overview

Determining key factors for technology ROI, benefits, architecture, etc. Evaluate how each strategic option affects the existing technology stack, identify required technology investments, assess architecture compatibility, and estimate the technology-related costs and risks of each alternative. This analysis ensures that strategic decisions account for technology enablement, constraints, and transformation requirements.
