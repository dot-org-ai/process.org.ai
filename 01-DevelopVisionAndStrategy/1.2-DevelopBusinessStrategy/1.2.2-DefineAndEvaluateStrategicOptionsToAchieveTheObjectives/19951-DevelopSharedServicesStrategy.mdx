# Develop shared services strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for shared services strategy development. Models the consolidation of internal support functions into shared service centers to achieve economies of scale, process standardization, and cost efficiency.

## Overview

Charting a plan to leverage internal services and support functions throughout the organization. Delineate a framework of parameters and criteria to selectively filter service areas for inclusion among the organizations common resources. Arrange the organizations functional areas to create efficiencies of scale in the delivery of internal services. Evaluate candidate functions for consolidation, design service catalogs, define service level agreements, and plan the transition from distributed to shared delivery models.

  functions: ['finance-accounting', 'hr-operations', 'it-service-desk', 'procurement'],
  criteria: ['transaction-volume', 'standardization-potential', 'cost-savings']
})

// Define service level agreements
const slas = await sharedServices.defineServiceLevelAgreements({
  serviceId: 'accounts-payable',
  metrics: ['processing-time', 'accuracy-rate', 'customer-satisfaction'],
  targets: { processingTime: '48-hours', accuracyRate: 0.995 }
