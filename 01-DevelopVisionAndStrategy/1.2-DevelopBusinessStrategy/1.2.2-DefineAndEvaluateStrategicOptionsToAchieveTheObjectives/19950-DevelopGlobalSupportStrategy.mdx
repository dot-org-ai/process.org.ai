# Develop global support strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for global support strategy development. Models the planning of worldwide support service deployment, regional optimization, and cross-border operational efficiency for enterprise support functions.

## Overview

Developing a plan to deploy support services and support functions throughout the organization globally. Arrange the organizations functional support areas to create efficiencies of scale in the delivery of support services, globally. Define regional support models, establish follow-the-sun coverage, optimize location strategies for support centers, and standardize service delivery processes across geographies.

const globalSupport = developGlobalSupportStrategy()

// Assess current support footprint
const footprint = await globalSupport.assessCurrentSupportFootprint({
  regions: ['North America', 'EMEA', 'APAC', 'LATAM'],
  dimensions: ['locations', 'headcount', 'capabilities', 'costs']
})

// Design follow-the-sun coverage
const coverage = await globalSupport.designFollowTheSunCoverage({
  supportTiers: ['tier-1', 'tier-2', 'tier-3'],
  targetSLA: { responseTime: '1-hour', resolutionTime: '4-hours' }
})
