# Develop innovation strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for innovation strategy development. Models the creation of a structured approach to fostering technological advancement, business model innovation, and new value proposition development.

## Overview

Developing a plan and vision to encourage advancements in technology or services. Create a roadmap for changing or innovating the business model to make business operations more competitive. Set up new R&D services for changing or bringing new value propositions, services, production processes, and invention of technology not previously used by competitors etc. Define innovation pillars, allocate R&D investment, establish idea pipeline processes, and build a culture of experimentation and rapid prototyping.
