# Develop innovation strategy and framework

> Business-as-Code definition for innovation strategy and framework development. Models the creation of a comprehensive innovation management system including governance structures, stage-gate processes, funding mechanisms, and performance measurement for systematic innovation delivery.

## Overview

Developing a plan and vision to encourage advancements in technology or product/services. Create a roadmap for changing or innovating the business model to make business operations more competitive. Set up new R&D services for changing or bringing new value propositions, services, production processes, and invention of technology not previously used by competitors etc. Establish the operational framework that governs how innovation ideas are sourced, evaluated, funded, developed, and commercialized.
