# Develop lean/continuous improvement strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for lean and continuous improvement strategy development. Models the creation of a systematic approach to process optimization, waste elimination, and performance advancement using lean, Six Sigma, and kaizen methodologies.

## Overview

Developing strategies for the optimization of processes and the improvement of functional areas in order to improve the bottom line. Create a road map of decision choices that would allow the organization to continuously enhance process efficiencies and advance performance standards. Define lean principles adoption, establish continuous improvement governance, select methodologies such as Six Sigma, Kaizen, and value stream mapping, and embed a culture of operational excellence.

const maturity = await improvement.assessProcessMaturity({
  functionalAreas: ['manufacturing', 'supply-chain', 'customer-service'],
  framework: 'CMMI'
})

// Prioritize improvement initiatives
const initiatives = await improvement.prioritizeImprovementInitiatives({
  criteria: ['cost-impact', 'strategic-alignment', 'feasibility'],
  methodology: 'weighted-scoring'
})
