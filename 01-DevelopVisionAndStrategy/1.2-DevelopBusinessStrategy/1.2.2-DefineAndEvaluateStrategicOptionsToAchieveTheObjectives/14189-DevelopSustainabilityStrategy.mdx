# Develop sustainability strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for sustainability strategy development. Models the formulation of ESG-aligned strategic initiatives that integrate environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and long-term business resilience into the organization's core strategy.

## Overview

Formulating strategic options that create opportunities for the sustenance and prosperity of the business in the long run. Go beyond business longevity to consider alternate strategies that allow the organizations preservation of vitality over time. Earmark resources and target processes, the former of which are dedicated to the absorption of sustainable practices in the latter. Define ESG goals, set emissions targets, evaluate circular economy opportunities, and embed sustainability into supply chain, operations, and product design.
