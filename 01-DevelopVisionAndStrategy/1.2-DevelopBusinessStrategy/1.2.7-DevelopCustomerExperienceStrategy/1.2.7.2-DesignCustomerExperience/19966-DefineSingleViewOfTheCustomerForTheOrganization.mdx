# Define single view of the customer for the organization

> Business-as-Code definition for unified customer data architecture. Models the creation of a consolidated, 360-degree customer profile that aggregates data from every channel, system, and interaction into a single authoritative record.

## Overview

Defining parameters to show aggregated, consistent, and holistic representation of known data about customers. Define key parameters which enable the tracking of customers and communications across every channel.
