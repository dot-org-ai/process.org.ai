// Conduct gap analysis against target state
const gaps = await capabilities.conductGapAnalysis({
  currentCapabilities: current.id,
  targetExperience: 'designed-cx-v2',
  prioritization: 'strategic-impact'
})

// Define acquisition plan for missing capabilities
const plan = await capabilities.defineAcquisitionPlan({
