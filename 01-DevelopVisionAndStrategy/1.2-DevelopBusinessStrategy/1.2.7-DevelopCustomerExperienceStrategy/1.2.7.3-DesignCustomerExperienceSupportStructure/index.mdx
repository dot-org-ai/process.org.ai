# Design customer experience support structure

> Business-as-Code definition for CX support structure design. Models the identification of required capabilities, technology platforms, organizational processes, and resource requirements needed to deliver and sustain the target customer experience.

## Overview

Creating a roadmap for customer experience support with an overall approach, process flow, and impact timeframe.

## Process Hierarchy

    A[Design customer experience support structure]
    A --> B[Identify required capabilities]
    A --> C[Identify impact on functional processes]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
design:
  object: Customer Experience Support Structure
  actor: CXManager
  result: CXSupportStructureDesign
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyRequiredCapabilities | Determine the skills, tools, and platforms needed for CX delivery |
| assessFunctionalProcessImpact | Evaluate how CX requirements affect existing functional processes |
| designSupportProcesses | Create the operational processes for CX support delivery |
| defineResourceRequirements | Specify the staffing, budget, and technology investments needed |
| developImplementationTimeline | Create a phased implementation plan for the support structure |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| requiredCapabilitiesIdentified | CX capability requirements documented |
| functionalProcessImpactAssessed | Impact on existing processes evaluated |
| supportProcessesDesigned | CX support operational processes created |
| resourceRequirementsDefined | Staffing and investment requirements specified |
| implementationTimelineDeveloped | Phased implementation plan completed |

## Usage

```typescript
import { designCustomerExperienceSupportStructure } from '@headlessly/design-customer-experience-support-structure'

const cxSupport = designCustomerExperienceSupportStructure()

// Identify required capabilities
const capabilities = await cxSupport.identifyRequiredCapabilities({
  experienceDesignId: 'cx-design-2026',
  categories: ['technology', 'talent', 'process', 'data']
})

// Assess functional process impact
const impact = await cxSupport.assessFunctionalProcessImpact({
  capabilityIds: capabilities.map(c => c.id),
  functionalAreas: ['sales', 'marketing', 'service', 'product']
})
```
