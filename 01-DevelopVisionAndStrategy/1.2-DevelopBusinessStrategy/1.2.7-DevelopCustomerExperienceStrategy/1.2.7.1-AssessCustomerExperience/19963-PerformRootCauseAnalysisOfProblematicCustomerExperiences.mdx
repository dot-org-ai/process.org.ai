# Perform root cause analysis of problematic customer experiences

> Business-as-Code definition for CX root cause analysis. Models the systematic investigation of underlying causes behind negative customer experiences using structured analysis techniques.

## Overview

Analyzing the core reason for the customer experience/feedback/response about the product/service to take considerable action for better customer experience. Apply root cause analysis techniques such as 5 Whys, fishbone diagrams, and Pareto analysis to identify systemic issues behind recurring customer experience problems and develop targeted corrective actions.
