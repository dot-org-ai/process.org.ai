# Develop customer experience roadmap to develop and implement defined capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for CX capability roadmap development. Models the creation of a phased implementation plan that sequences capability investments, defines milestones, and aligns talent and technology resources to achieve customer experience goals.

## Overview

Defining a standard guideline to create and execute the capacities of registering customer experiences in a timely manner. Create a common understanding of what behaviors are required to implement the strategy. Define what talent/skills your organization needs to reach customer experience goals.

// Consolidate capability requirements
const requirements = await roadmap.consolidateCapabilityRequirements({
  sources: ['cx-design', 'support-structure-analysis', 'capability-gap-assessment'],
  prioritization: 'strategic-impact'
})

// Define implementation phases
const phases = await roadmap.defineImplementationPhases({
  requirements: requirements.prioritized,
  horizons: ['0-6-months', '6-12-months', '12-24-months'],
  dependencies: true
})

// Build the implementation timeline
const timeline = await roadmap.buildTimeline({
  phases: phases.map(p => p.id),
  startDate: '2026-Q2',
  milestoneFrequency: 'monthly'
