# Determine optimal portfolio

> Business-as-Code definition for optimal portfolio determination. Models the synthesis of growth, market share, and cash flow analyses to define the target portfolio mix that maximizes strategic value and financial returns.

## Overview

Determining the optimal portfolio mix by synthesizing growth potential, relative market share, and cash flow analyses for each business unit or product line. Apply portfolio optimization frameworks to recommend invest, hold, harvest, or divest decisions. Balance strategic priorities such as market leadership, diversification, risk management, and capital efficiency to define the target portfolio that maximizes long-term shareholder value.
