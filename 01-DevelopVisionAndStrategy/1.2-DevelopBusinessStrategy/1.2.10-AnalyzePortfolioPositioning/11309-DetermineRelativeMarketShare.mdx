# Determine relative market share

> Business-as-Code definition for relative market share determination. Models the calculation, benchmarking, and tracking of the organization's market share position relative to its largest competitor across each business unit and product line.

## Overview

Determining the relative market share of each business unit or product line by comparing the organization's market share to that of its largest competitor. This metric is a cornerstone of portfolio analysis frameworks such as the BCG growth-share matrix. Calculate share positions using revenue, unit volume, or customer count data, and track share movements over time to identify gaining or declining portfolio elements.
