# Assess cash flow potential

> Business-as-Code definition for cash flow potential assessment. Models the evaluation of cash generation capacity, capital requirements, and net cash flow contribution for each business unit within the corporate portfolio.

## Overview

Assessing the cash flow potential of each business unit or product line within the portfolio. Evaluate operating cash generation, capital expenditure requirements, working capital needs, and free cash flow contribution to determine whether a portfolio element is a net cash generator or cash consumer. This assessment is critical for portfolio positioning frameworks and capital allocation decisions.
