# Define current business

> Business-as-Code definition for current business state definition. Models the documentation of the organization's core products, markets, value proposition, operational model, and competitive position as the foundation for mission development.

## Overview

Defining the status quo relating to the de facto core of what the business is. Reflect over the fundamental essence of what the business accomplishes and the manner in which it operates. Look beyond the obvious solution capabilities to delineate capacities that form the basis of the business engine. Involve senior executives and management personnel and possibly professional services providers.
