# Describe means to achieve desired state

> Business-as-Code definition for describing the means to achieve the desired organizational state. Models the gap analysis between current and future state, identification of strategic pathways, capability requirements, and enablers needed to bridge the gap.

## Overview

Outlining the strategic pathways and enabling mechanisms required to move the organization from its current state to its desired future state. Conduct a thorough gap analysis comparing the current business definition with the strategic vision, then identify the capabilities, resources, and initiatives necessary to close those gaps.
