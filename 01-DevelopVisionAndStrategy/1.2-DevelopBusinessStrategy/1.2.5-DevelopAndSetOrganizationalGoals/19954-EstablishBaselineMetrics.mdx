# Establish baseline metrics

> Business-as-Code definition for baseline metrics establishment. Models the creation of performance measurement baselines, KPI definitions, data collection methods, and benchmarking standards that enable goal tracking.

## Overview

Establishing baselines that provide standards for assessing performance. Create metrics and KPIs for various functions, processes, and activities based on organizational goals. Define data sources, measurement methodologies, reporting frequencies, and acceptable thresholds to enable objective performance monitoring and continuous improvement.

const baselines = establishBaselineMetrics()

// Define KPIs for organizational goals
const kpis = await baselines.defineKPIs({
  goalIds: ['revenue-growth', 'customer-retention', 'operational-efficiency'],
  metricTypes: ['financial', 'customer', 'process', 'learning']
})

// Collect baseline data
const baseline = await baselines.collectBaselineData({
  kpiIds: kpis.map(k => k.id),
  period: 'trailing-12-months',
  dataSources: ['erp', 'crm', 'hris']
})
```
