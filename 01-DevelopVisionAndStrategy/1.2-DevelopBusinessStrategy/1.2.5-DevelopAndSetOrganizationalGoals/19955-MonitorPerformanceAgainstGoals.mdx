# Monitor performance against goals

> Business-as-Code definition for performance monitoring against goals. Models the ongoing tracking, analysis, and reporting of organizational performance relative to established goals and baselines.

## Overview

Defining methodology and frequency of assessment for measuring and monitoring performance of various functions, processes, and activities against standard set goals. Track KPI trends, generate performance dashboards, conduct variance analysis, trigger corrective actions when performance deviates from targets, and report progress to stakeholders at regular intervals.

const monitoring = monitorPerformanceAgainstGoals()

// Analyze variances against targets
const variances = await monitoring.analyzeVariances({
  goalIds: ['revenue-growth', 'customer-retention', 'nps'],
  period: 'Q4-2025',
  threshold: 0.1
})

// Trigger corrective actions for underperforming areas
const actions = await monitoring.triggerCorrectiveActions({
  varianceIds: variances.filter(v => v.severity === 'critical').map(v => v.id),
  actionType: 'executive-review',
  dueDate: '2025-12-31'
