# Identify organizational goals

> Business-as-Code definition for organizational goal identification. Models the process of deriving strategic objectives from mission and vision, cascading them across the organization, and ensuring they are specific, measurable, and time-bound.

## Overview

Creating and developing strategic objectives that establishes a process to outline expected outcomes and guide employees' efforts. Translate the organizational mission and strategic priorities into concrete, measurable goals using frameworks such as OKR, balanced scorecard, or SMART goals. Ensure that goals cascade from enterprise level to functional and individual levels, creating alignment and accountability.
