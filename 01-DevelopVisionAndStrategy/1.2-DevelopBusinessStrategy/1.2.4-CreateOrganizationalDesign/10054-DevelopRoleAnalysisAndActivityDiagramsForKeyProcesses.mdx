# Develop role analysis and activity diagrams for key processes

> Business-as-Code definition for key process role analysis and activity diagramming. Models the decomposition of critical business processes into activities and the mapping of appropriate roles against each activity for optimal staffing.

## Overview

Creating an understanding of the fit between job roles and organizational processes in order to properly place personnel. Deconstruct key processes into constituent activities, and examine job-related roles. Take cues from Develop role activity diagrams to assess hand-off activity [10051]. Map appropriate positions against these important processes, which in turn expedite the deployment of staff members.

import { developRoleAnalysisAndActivityDiagramsForKeyProcesses } from '@headlessly/develop-role-analysis-and-activity-diagrams-for-key-processes'

const roleAnalysis = developRoleAnalysisAndActivityDiagramsForKeyProcesses()

// Decompose a key process into activities
const activities = await roleAnalysis.decomposeProcessActivities({
  processId: 'order-to-cash',
  granularity: 'task-level'
})

// Map roles to process activities
const mapping = await roleAnalysis.mapRolesToActivities({
  processId: 'order-to-cash',
  matchCriteria: ['competency', 'capacity', 'location']
})
```
