# Develop role activity diagrams to assess hand-off activity

> Business-as-Code definition for role activity diagram development. Models the decomposition of job roles into discrete activities and the visualization of hand-off points between roles to optimize delegation and workflow efficiency.

## Overview

Examining the constituent exercises and undertakings within a work-related position for the purpose of effective delegation. Deconstruct job-specific roles into activities and visualize the relations among them, with the objective of assigning responsibilities to the appropriate personnel. Identify hand-off points, bottlenecks, and unnecessary transfers of work between roles to streamline workflows and reduce cycle times.

const diagrams = developRoleActivityDiagramsToAssessHandOffActivity()

// Map hand-off points for a process
const handOffs = await diagrams.mapHandOffPoints({
  processId: 'order-to-cash',
  roles: ['sales-rep', 'order-processor', 'warehouse', 'shipping', 'billing']
})

// Analyze hand-off efficiency
const efficiency = await diagrams.analyzeHandOffEfficiency({
  processId: 'order-to-cash',
  metrics: ['cycle-time', 'error-rate', 'rework-frequency']
})
```
