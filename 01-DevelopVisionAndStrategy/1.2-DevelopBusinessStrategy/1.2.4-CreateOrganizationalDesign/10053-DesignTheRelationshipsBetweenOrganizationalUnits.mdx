# Design the relationships between organizational units

> Business-as-Code definition for inter-unit relationship design. Models the definition of connections, dependencies, shared resources, and governance mechanisms between organizational units.

## Overview

Fleshing out the connections and dependencies among the various units of the organization. Delineate the relationship among business units or process frameworks within the organization, in terms of activities, synergies, and shared resources and responsibilities. Formalize relationships among business units so that any mutual coherence is clearly understood and can be attended to. Define matrix relationships, dotted-line reporting, shared service agreements, and cross-functional coordination mechanisms.

const unitDesign = designRelationshipsBetweenOrganizationalUnits()

// Map dependencies between units
const dependencies = await unitDesign.mapUnitDependencies({
  units: ['sales', 'marketing', 'product', 'engineering', 'customer-success'],
  dependencyTypes: ['data-flow', 'process-handoff', 'shared-resources']
})

// Establish internal service agreements
const sla = await unitDesign.establishServiceAgreements({
  providerUnit: 'it-shared-services',
  consumerUnit: 'sales',
  services: ['crm-support', 'data-analytics', 'reporting']
})
```
