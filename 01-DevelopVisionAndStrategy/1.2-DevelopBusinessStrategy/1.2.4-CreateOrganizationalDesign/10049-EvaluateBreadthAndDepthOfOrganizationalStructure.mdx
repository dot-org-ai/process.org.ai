# Evaluate breadth and depth of organizational structure

> Business-as-Code definition for organizational structure evaluation. Models the assessment of organizational breadth, hierarchy depth, span of control, and structural synergies to determine optimal organizational architecture.

## Overview

Evaluating the structural makeup of the organization, including pertinent features of and associated synergies among constituent elements. Examine the organization's architectural framework, paying close attention to the individual elements, the relations among them, and the conjoint and co-acting forces therein. Analyze functions and processes, as well as work-related positions. Scrutinize various relevant characteristics associated with each of them, depending upon the scale, scope, and type of organization.
