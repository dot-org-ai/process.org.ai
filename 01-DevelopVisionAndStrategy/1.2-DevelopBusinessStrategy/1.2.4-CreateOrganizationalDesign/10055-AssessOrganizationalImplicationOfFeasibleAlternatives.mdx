# Assess organizational implication of feasible alternatives

> Business-as-Code definition for organizational impact assessment of design alternatives. Models the evaluation of workforce, culture, cost, and operational implications for each feasible organizational structure option.

## Overview

Probing the repercussions of all practicable organizational design options. Analyze the significance and impact of workable organizational structure options. Closely examine the long-term impact of these frameworks over the functioning of the organization. Evaluate workforce displacement, cultural change requirements, cost implications, and operational disruption for each design alternative to select the optimal structure.
