# Perform job-specific roles mapping and value-added analyses

> Business-as-Code definition for job-specific roles mapping and value-added analysis. Models the systematic mapping of organizational roles, their activities, and the value each contributes to the overall operation.

## Overview

Appraising job-specific roles within the organizational chart and their hierarchical architecture. Analyze a map of work-related roles within the organizational structure. Examine the value added by the positions associated with jobs to be performed and how they stack up within the organization's operations. Classify activities as value-adding, necessary non-value-adding, or waste to inform organizational redesign.

const classification = await roleMapping.classifyActivities({
  department: 'operations',
  categories: ['value-adding', 'necessary-support', 'non-value-adding'],
  methodology: 'lean-value-stream'
})

// Identify role redundancies
const redundancies = await roleMapping.identifyRoleRedundancies({
  scope: 'enterprise-wide',
  overlapThreshold: 0.6
