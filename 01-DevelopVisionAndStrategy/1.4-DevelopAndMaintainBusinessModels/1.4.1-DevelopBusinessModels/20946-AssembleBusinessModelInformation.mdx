// Identify value proposition
const valueProp = await assembly.identifyValueProposition({
  customerSegments: ['enterprise', 'mid-market', 'startup'],
  differentiators: ['speed-to-value', 'customization', 'support']
})

// Map revenue streams
const revenue = await assembly.mapRevenueStreams({
  types: ['subscription', 'usage-based', 'professional-services'],
  projectionHorizon: '3-years'
})

// Compile key resources
const resources = await assembly.compileKeyResources({
