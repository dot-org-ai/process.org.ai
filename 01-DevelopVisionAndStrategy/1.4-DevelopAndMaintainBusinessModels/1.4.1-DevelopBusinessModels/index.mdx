# Develop business models

> Business-as-Code definition for business model development. Models the end-to-end process of creating viable business models, from assembling market and financial information through securing approvals, integrating with existing models, and formal organizational adoption.

## Overview

Creating an economic model that describes the goals of an organization and the business processes needed to achieve those goals. This involves information gathering, securing necessary approvals and authorizations, integrating with preexisting models, including the general business concept [10002] and business strategy [10015], and formally accepting the model as the basis for organization's day-to-day operations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { developBusinessModels } from '@headlessly/develop-business-models'

const models = developBusinessModels()

// Initiate model development
const initiative = await models.initiateModelDevelopment({
  name: 'platform-business-model-v3',
  scope: 'full-canvas',
  objectives: ['expand-TAM', 'improve-unit-economics', 'enable-partner-ecosystem']
})

// Design the business model canvas
const canvas = await models.designBusinessModelCanvas({
  initiativeId: initiative.id,
  components: ['value-proposition', 'customer-segments', 'revenue-streams', 'cost-structure', 'channels', 'key-resources', 'key-activities', 'key-partnerships']
})

// Validate model assumptions
const validation = await models.validateModelAssumptions({
  canvasId: canvas.id,
  assumptions: ['tam-growth-15pct', 'cac-payback-12mo', 'partner-attach-rate-30pct'],
  dataSources: ['market-research', 'financial-projections', 'customer-interviews']
