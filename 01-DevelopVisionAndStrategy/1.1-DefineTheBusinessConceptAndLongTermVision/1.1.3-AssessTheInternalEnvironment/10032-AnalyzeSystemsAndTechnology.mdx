# Analyze systems and technology

> Business-as-Code definition for systems and technology analysis. Models the evaluation of deployed technology systems, infrastructure maturity, automation capabilities, and technical debt to guide IT strategy and investment decisions.

## Overview

Analyzing the capabilities of technology and process automation systems deployed within the organization in order to direct future associated processes. Conduct a broad-based survey to examine various aspects associated with such systems and technologies, with the objective of identifying key facets that are of interest. Investigate the intended purpose, purpose served, utility, longevity, remaining service-life, repair or service requirements, etc.

  categories: ['ERP', 'CRM', 'data-platform', 'custom-applications']
})

// Assess technology maturity
const maturity = await techAnalysis.assessMaturity({
  systemIds: inventory.map(s => s.id),
  framework: 'CMMI'
})
```
