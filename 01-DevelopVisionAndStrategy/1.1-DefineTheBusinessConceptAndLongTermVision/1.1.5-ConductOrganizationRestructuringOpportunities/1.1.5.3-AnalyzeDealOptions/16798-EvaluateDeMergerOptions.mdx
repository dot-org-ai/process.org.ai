# Evaluate de-merger options

> Business-as-Code definition for de-merger option evaluation. Models the assessment of separation scenarios for previously merged entities or subsidiaries, including standalone viability, value unlocking potential, and operational disentanglement planning.

## Overview

Evaluating departments and subsidiaries within the organization, and/or previously merged entities, to assess the appropriateness of a de-merger, taking account of the fit between these entities as well as any relevant externalities. Examine the pertinence and soundness of a formalized dissociation.
