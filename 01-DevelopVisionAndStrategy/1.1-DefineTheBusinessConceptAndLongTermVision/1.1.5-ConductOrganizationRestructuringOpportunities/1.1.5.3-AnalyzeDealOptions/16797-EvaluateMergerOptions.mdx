# Evaluate merger options

> Business-as-Code definition for merger option evaluation. Models the assessment of potential merger partners including cultural compatibility, combined entity valuation, governance structure, and synergy realization potential.

## Overview

Appraising entities identified as being suitable for a merger, taking stock of the restructuring opportunities within the firm and the market. Verify the appropriateness and viability of such options. Assess these entities to ensure their pertinence to the contextual state-of-affairs in the market, as well as a fit with the resources and capabilities of the organization itself. (This process can be carried out, in its entirety, by qualified in-house personnel or may be designated to specialist professional services providers.)
