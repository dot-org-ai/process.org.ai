# Analyze and evaluate competition

> Business-as-Code definition for competitive force analysis and evaluation. Models the aggregation of competitive intelligence, benchmarking of processes and metrics, and synthesis of competitive insights for strategic decision-making.

## Overview

Assessing the competitive forces in the marketplace that could potentially affect the organization. Analyze various aspects of business competition including competing firms. Aggregate competitive intelligence, create benchmarks to juxtapose processes and performance metrics, and inject crucial information about the competition into management models to synthesize insights.
