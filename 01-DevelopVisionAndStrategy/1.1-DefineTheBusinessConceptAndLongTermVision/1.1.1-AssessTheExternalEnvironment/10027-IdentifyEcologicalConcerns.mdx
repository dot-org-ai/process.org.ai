# Identify ecological concerns

> Business-as-Code definition for ecological concern identification. Models the monitoring and analysis of environmental, climate, and ecological risks that may impact the organization's operations, compliance, and sustainability strategy.

## Overview

Identifying changes in ecological ecosystems that can be directly or indirectly detrimental to the organization. Analyze ecological factors within the immediate ecosystem for near to middle-term impact. Analyze the ecology, at large, to get a sense of long-term shifts and concerns. Gather analyses from research publications. Speak to subject matter experts. Engage with advocacy groups, lawyers, journalists, and the active populations.
