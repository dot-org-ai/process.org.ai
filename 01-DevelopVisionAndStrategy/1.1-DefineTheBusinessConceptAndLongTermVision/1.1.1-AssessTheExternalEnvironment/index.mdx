# Assess the external environment

> Business-as-Code definition for external environment assessment. Models the systematic analysis of competitive forces, economic trends, regulatory landscape, technology innovations, demographics, and ecological factors that shape organizational strategy.

## Overview

Assessing all forces, entities, and systems that are external to an organization but can affect its operation. Analyze far-reaching currents in the macroeconomic situation, assess the competition, evaluate technological changes, and identify societal as well as ecological issues of concern. Create a big-picture understanding of externalities, with sufficient depth across individual aspects.
