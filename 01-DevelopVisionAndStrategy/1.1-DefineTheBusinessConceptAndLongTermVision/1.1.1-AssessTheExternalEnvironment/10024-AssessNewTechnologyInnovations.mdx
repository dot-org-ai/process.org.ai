# Assess new technology innovations

> Business-as-Code definition for technology innovation assessment. Models the scanning, evaluation, and feasibility analysis of emerging, disruptive, and currently deployed technologies relevant to the business.

## Overview

Assessing developments in technologies presently being used by the business, new technologies that have a potential for the business, and any disruptive innovations. Conduct a survey of advancement in technologies that are already deployed with inputs from the personnel closely working with them, tracking utility and feasibility for deployment. Arrange for mid- to senior-level management personnel who explore contingent uses to assess new and disruptive technologies. Follow up with desk research, involving physical scoping and viability assessment.

```typescript
import { assessNewTechnologyInnovations } from '@headlessly/assess-new-technology-innovations'

const techInnovation = assessNewTechnologyInnovations()

// Scan for emerging technologies
const radar = await techInnovation.scanTechnologies({
  domains: ['artificial-intelligence', 'quantum-computing', 'edge-computing'],
  sources: ['academic-research', 'patent-filings', 'vendor-briefings']
})

// Assess feasibility for top candidates
const feasibility = await techInnovation.assessFeasibility({
  technologyId: radar.topCandidates[0].id,
  criteria: ['cost', 'complexity', 'time-to-value', 'strategic-fit']
})
