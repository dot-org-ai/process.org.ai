# Analyze demographics

> Business-as-Code definition for demographic analysis. Models the collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation of population data to inform market segmentation and strategic planning.

## Overview

Analyzing statistical data relating to the size, distribution, and composition of relevant populations, as well as their characteristics. Perform quantitative analysis over raw data-sets gathered from well-founded sources such as government census or large, private databases. Consider employing primary research in collecting required statistics. Use comprehensive studies (reports, briefs, and articles) to assist with the analysis, in place of raw data.
