# Identify economic trends

> Business-as-Code definition for macroeconomic trend identification. Models the monitoring, analysis, and forecasting of economic indicators that influence organizational strategy and planning.

## Overview

Determining large-scale macroeconomic shifts and trends, with medium to long-term relevance for the organization. Vet the immediate and the larger economic ecosystem to identify broad-based movements that affect the organization. In the immediate vicinity, for example, examine the stock price of key vendors/suppliers in the organizational value-chain. In the larger economic ecosystem, analyze according to geographical distribution where factors such as interest rates, taxation structures, oil prices, and unemployment rates are explored.
