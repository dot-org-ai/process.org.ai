# Monitor and manage customer demand

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for monitor and manage customer demand (airline)

## Overview

Determining how to meet demand so that revenue is maximized.  The most profitable markets are determined, followed by a forecast of the demand at each fare class and an allocation of inventory at each bucket (fare class, channel).  Corporate business account holders news is monitored and based on this, incentives for both corporates and individuals are determined.  The tradeoff between opportunity cost of unsold inventory and cost of over sales is evaluated and the overbooking quota by channel, fare class is then determined.  Demand management is optimized.  (An appropriate mathematical technique for an optimized Demand Management from several approaches available (O&D/leg based; Dynamic/Static; Deterministic/Stochastic) is chosen.)
