# Perform forward parts requirements forecasting

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for perform forward parts requirements forecasting (aerospace-and-defense)

## Overview

Analyzing historical needs to forecast future requirements. This capability requires taking a snapshot of the requirements in the past, comparing the requirements under the circumstances under which those requirements were generated, using a combination of both quantitative methods and subjective analysis to extrapolate requirements for parts based on a customer's future requirement projections.  Some examples of current conditions may include fleet growth, current schedules that are in operation that help define part needs, etc.
