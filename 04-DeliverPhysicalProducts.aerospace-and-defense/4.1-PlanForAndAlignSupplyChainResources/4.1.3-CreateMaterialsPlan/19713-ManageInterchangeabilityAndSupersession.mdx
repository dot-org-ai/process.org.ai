# Manage interchangeability and supersession

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for manage interchangeability and supersession (aerospace-and-defense)

## Overview

Determining continued parts purchasing.  Supersession is a commercial decision. From a commercial perspective, a company takes a strategic decision that it will no longer buy a part that is fully interchangeable, e.g.. For pricing reasons, for quality reasons etc. Rather than dealing with Parts A,B,C,D that are fully interchangeable, it will only now deal with Parts C and D. A is too expensive, B is too low quality.
