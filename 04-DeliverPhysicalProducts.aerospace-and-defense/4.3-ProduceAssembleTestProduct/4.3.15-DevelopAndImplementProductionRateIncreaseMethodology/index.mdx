# Develop and implement production rate increase methodology

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for develop and implement production rate increase methodology (aerospace-and-defense)

## Overview

Developing global production rate methodology. This is required in order to assess on a global basis if all suppliers have the capability to be able to absorb / prepare for an end product rate increase within a predefined timeframe.
