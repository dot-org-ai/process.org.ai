# Design and prototype aircraft

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for design and prototype aircraft (aerospace-and-defense)

## Overview

Creating and evaluating new products/services, with the objective of readying them for production. Undertake the design and development of new products/services. Allocate resources to these projects, create specifications, ensure compliance, conduct prototyping, test, and conduct on-boarding of supply-chain stakeholders. Enlist R&D staff, with the involvement of functional heads, in this iterative process.
