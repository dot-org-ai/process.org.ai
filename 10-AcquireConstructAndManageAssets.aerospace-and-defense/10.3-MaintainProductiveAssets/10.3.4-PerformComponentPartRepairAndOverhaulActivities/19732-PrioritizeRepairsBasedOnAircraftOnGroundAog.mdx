# Prioritize repairs (based on aircraft on ground (AOG))

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for prioritize repairs (based on aircraft on ground (aog)) (aerospace-and-defense)

## Overview

Prioritizing repair work based on preset factors , requirements, and need. These factors include: 1. The SLA associated with a customer/part combination 2.  Number of these parts already on order 3. Are parts open loop (customer needs a working part back, not necessarily the same serialized part) or closed loop (customer will only accept the same serial numbered part back). Once the prioritization of work is completed, the sequence will have to be checked for feasibility against the available resources vs required resources. The output of this is called a nominal repair prioritization sequence. The nominal sequence can be interrupted at any time by AOG part arrivals, where AOG parts take precedence and may even interrupt normal operation, requiring continuous re-scheduling and re-sequencing. The situation gets more complex when multiple AOGs arrive at the same time.
