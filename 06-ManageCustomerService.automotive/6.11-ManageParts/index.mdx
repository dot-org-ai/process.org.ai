# Manage parts

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for manage parts (automotive)

## Overview

The aftermarket parts sector also forms part of the automotive industry supply chain. Suppliers manufacture components, ready-made parts, and accessories for vehicles that have already been sold. During the retailing stage, these parts are sent to retailers and dealers, who sell these products to the customer. In the Manage parts process group, inventory and electronic parts catalogues are managed, parts are exchanged/located, returns are managed, parts are rebuilt, and the retail operations are managed.
