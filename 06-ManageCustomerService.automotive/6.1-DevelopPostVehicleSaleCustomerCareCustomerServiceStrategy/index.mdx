> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for develop post vehicle sale, customer care/customer service strategy (automotive)

## Overview

This process group involves understanding and segmenting customers, creating policies to govern customer service, and setting service targets and priorities. Some of these determinations may be informed by segmentation and relationship building that occurred within process “market and sell products and services”. This strategy governs the way the organization provides service to customers proactively or in response to customer requests/issues. It also includes the integration of dealer standards into customer care practices and the development of vehicle after sales part and service plans. In addition, assessing the market and strategy, tracking and researching the market, and performing competitive benchmarking are addressed.
