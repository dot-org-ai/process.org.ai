# Develop solution and delivery approach

> Business-as-Code definition for solution and delivery approach development. Models the design of the proposed solution architecture, implementation methodology, delivery timeline, and resource plan to address customer requirements.

## Overview

Creating a plan with detailed steps about how produce and deliver the goods or services.

```typescript
import { developSolutionAndDeliveryApproach } from '@headlessly/develop-solution-and-delivery-approach'

const solution = developSolutionAndDeliveryApproach()

// Design solution architecture
const architecture = await solution.designSolutionArchitecture({
  rfpId: 'rfp-001',
  requirements: refinedRequirements,
  components: ['platform', 'integrations', 'data-migration', 'training']
})

// Plan implementation timeline
const timeline = await solution.planImplementationTimeline({
  solutionId: architecture.id,
  phases: ['discovery', 'build', 'test', 'deploy', 'hypercare'],
  totalDuration: { months: 6 }
})
```
