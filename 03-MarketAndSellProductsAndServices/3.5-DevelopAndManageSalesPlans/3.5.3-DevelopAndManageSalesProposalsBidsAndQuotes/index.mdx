# Develop and manage sales proposals, bids, and quotes

> Business-as-Code definition for sales proposal, bid, and quote management. Models the complete RFP/RFQ lifecycle from requirement intake and solution design through pricing, profitability analysis, internal approval, submission, and outcome management.

## Overview

Understanding and refining the customer requirements as provided in a RFP (Request for Proposal) or RFI (Request for Information).  When compiling the response, they must take into consideration whether the requirements are a match with the strategic or tactical plans of the organization and whether they are able to submit a bid/proposal that is competitive based on an understanding of the offerings of other competing organizations. The next step will be to define the pricing and scheduling of the proposed solution and determine whether the proposal will be profitable for the company if accepted. The bid is then submitted and a notification of whether or not it was successful is received.
