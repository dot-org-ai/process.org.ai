> Business-as-Code definition for lead identification and reception. Models the process of capturing, profiling, and triangulating inbound and outbound leads by evaluating prospect behavior, existing product usage, and decision-making authority.

## Overview

Build a detailed profile of the prospects. Determine what products/services they already use, if they have decision-making authority, their views on the products/services they already use, how prone they are to switch, if the organization's solution better in some attributes than those prospects currently use, etc.
