const pipeline = manageOpportunityPipeline()

// Analyze pipeline velocity
const velocity = await pipeline.analyzePipelineVelocity({
  period: 'current-quarter',
  segmentBy: ['stage', 'territory', 'deal-size-tier']
})

// Assess pipeline coverage
const coverage = await pipeline.assessPipelineCoverage({
  quotaTarget: 5000000,
  includeWeightedValue: true,
  excludeStages: ['closed-lost', 'closed-won']
})
```
