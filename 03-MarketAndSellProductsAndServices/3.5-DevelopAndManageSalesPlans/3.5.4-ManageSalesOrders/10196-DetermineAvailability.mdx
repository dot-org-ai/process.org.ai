# Determine availability

> Business-as-Code definition for product and service availability determination. Models the process of checking inventory levels, production capacity, and service availability to confirm whether customer orders can be fulfilled on the requested timeline.

## Overview

Ascertaining the volume or scale of products/services to provide to customers to fulfill sales orders. Check the finished products stored in warehouses, the production capacity, and (in the case of services) the processing speed, as well as work force availability.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| checkInventoryLevels | Query current stock levels across warehouses and distribution centers for ordered items |
| assessProductionCapacity | Evaluate manufacturing or service delivery capacity to fulfill orders not covered by stock |
| calculateAvailableToPromise | Determine the quantity available to promise for each line item based on inventory and demand |
| reserveInventory | Allocate available inventory to the sales order to prevent overselling |
| estimateDeliveryDate | Calculate expected delivery dates based on stock location, production lead times, and logistics |
| communicateAvailabilityStatus | Notify sales and the customer of availability results and any constraints |

## Usage

```typescript
import { determineAvailability } from '@headlessly/determine-availability'

const availability = determineAvailability()

// Check inventory and calculate available to promise
const atp = await availability.calculateAvailableToPromise({
  lineItems: [
    { productId: 'SKU-1001', quantity: 50 },
    { productId: 'SKU-1002', quantity: 25 }
  ],
  requestedDate: '2026-03-15',
  locations: ['warehouse-east', 'warehouse-west']
})

// Reserve inventory for confirmed order
const reservation = await availability.reserveInventory({
  orderId: 'SO-2026-10501',
  lineItems: atp.availableItems,
  reservationExpiry: '2026-02-20T23:59:59Z'
