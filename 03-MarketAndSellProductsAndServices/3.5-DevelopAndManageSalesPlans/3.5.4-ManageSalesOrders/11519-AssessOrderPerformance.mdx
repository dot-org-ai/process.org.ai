# Assess order performance

> Business-as-Code definition for order performance assessment. Models the measurement and evaluation of order processing efficiency, fulfillment accuracy, delivery timeliness, and customer satisfaction across the order management lifecycle.

## Overview

Evaluating the operational performance of the order management process across key dimensions including processing speed, fulfillment accuracy, on-time delivery, and cost efficiency. Measure order-to-cash cycle times, identify bottlenecks, and benchmark performance against targets and industry standards to drive continuous improvement.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| measureOrderCycleTime | Calculate the elapsed time from order receipt to delivery for each order and segment |
| evaluateFulfillmentAccuracy | Assess the percentage of orders fulfilled completely and correctly without errors |
| trackOnTimeDelivery | Monitor the percentage of orders delivered by the promised date |
| analyzeOrderCostEfficiency | Calculate the cost per order processed across order management operations |
| identifyPerformanceBottlenecks | Pinpoint process steps that create delays or errors in the order lifecycle |
| benchmarkAgainstTargets | Compare actual order performance metrics against established goals and industry standards |

import { assessOrderPerformance } from '@headlessly/assess-order-performance'

const performance = assessOrderPerformance()

// Measure order cycle times by segment
const cycleTimes = await performance.measureOrderCycleTime({
  period: 'last-quarter',
  segments: ['enterprise', 'mid-market', 'smb'],
  breakdownBy: ['validation', 'fulfillment', 'shipping', 'delivery'],
  compareWith: 'prior-quarter'
})

// Identify performance bottlenecks
const bottlenecks = await performance.identifyPerformanceBottlenecks({
  period: 'last-quarter',
  thresholds: { maxCycleTime: 5, minAccuracy: 0.98, minOnTime: 0.95 },
  analyzeRootCauses: true
})
