# Enter orders into system

> Business-as-Code definition for sales order system entry. Models the recording of validated sales orders into enterprise systems, triggering downstream fulfillment, billing, and analytics workflows.

## Overview

Analyzing all data relating to sales orders by entering it into a centralized repository, and using the insights generated to create opportunities for cross-/up-selling. Maintain up-to-date records of sales, along with current status. Include all sales activity with relevant information about the associated customers, and identify patterns in the data. Glean insights from these patterns to persuade customers to purchase additional offerings or upgrade purchased products/services.
