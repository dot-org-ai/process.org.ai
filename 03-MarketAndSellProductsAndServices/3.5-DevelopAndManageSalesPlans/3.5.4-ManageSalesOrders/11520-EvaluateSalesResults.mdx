# Evaluate sales results

> Business-as-Code definition for sales results evaluation. Models the analysis of sales outcomes against targets, quotas, and forecasts to measure team effectiveness and inform future planning.

## Overview

Evaluating actual sales performance against established targets, quotas, and forecasts. Compare revenue, volume, and margin results by territory, product, channel, and sales representative. Identify overperforming and underperforming areas, analyze win/loss patterns, and generate insights that inform sales strategy adjustments and resource reallocation.
