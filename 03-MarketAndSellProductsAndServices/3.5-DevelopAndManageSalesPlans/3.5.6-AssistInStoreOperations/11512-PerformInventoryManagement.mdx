# Perform inventory management

> Business-as-Code definition for in-store inventory management. Models the process of tracking stock levels, conducting cycle counts, managing replenishment triggers, and ensuring shelf availability at retail locations.

## Overview

Performing in-store inventory management to maintain optimal stock levels for retail operations. Monitor product availability on shelves, track inventory movements across the store, conduct periodic cycle counts, and trigger replenishment orders when stock falls below defined thresholds. Coordinate with warehouse and distribution teams to prevent out-of-stock and overstock conditions.
