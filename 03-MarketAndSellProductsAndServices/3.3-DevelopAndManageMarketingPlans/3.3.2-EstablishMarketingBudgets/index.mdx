# Establish marketing budgets

> Business-as-Code definition for marketing budget planning and allocation. Models the end-to-end process of aligning marketing spend with business strategy, estimating costs, creating budgets, and projecting return on investment across all marketing activities.

## Overview

Creating a budget for the organization's marketing efforts, in line with the business-wide strategic outlook. Create a plan to distribute resources for achieving the marketing strategy in light of the overall business strategy. Make cost assumptions; calculate the estimated total revenue from the marketing activities against the costs/expenses of these activities. Forecast the return on investment. Attribute costs to the appropriate marketing activities such as promotional campaigns, advertising, marketing communications, PR campaigns, personnel, and office space. Enlist the financial and marketing functions.
