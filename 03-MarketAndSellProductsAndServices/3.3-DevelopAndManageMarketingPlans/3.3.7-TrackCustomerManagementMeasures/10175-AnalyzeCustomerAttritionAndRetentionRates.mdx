# Analyze customer attrition and retention rates

> Business-as-Code definition for customer churn and retention analysis. Models the measurement and investigation of customer attrition patterns and retention dynamics to identify at-risk customers and inform retention strategies.

## Overview

Calculating measures that capture the proportion of customers the organization is able to retain to those it is losing. Compute metrics such as the tendency to switch brands/providers and the proportion of return customers to comprehend the trends within the customer attrition and retention rates.
