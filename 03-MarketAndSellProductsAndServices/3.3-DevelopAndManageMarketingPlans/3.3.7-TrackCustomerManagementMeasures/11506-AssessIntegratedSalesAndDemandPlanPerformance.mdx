# Assess integrated sales and demand plan performance

> Business-as-Code definition for integrated sales and demand plan assessment. Models the evaluation of how well actual sales performance aligns with demand forecasts and sales plans to identify gaps and improve planning accuracy.

## Overview

Evaluating the alignment between actual sales results and the integrated sales and demand plan. Compare forecasted demand, planned sales targets, and actual performance to identify variances, understand their causes, and improve the accuracy of future planning cycles. Assess whether marketing activities, pricing decisions, and promotional programs effectively drove the expected demand.
