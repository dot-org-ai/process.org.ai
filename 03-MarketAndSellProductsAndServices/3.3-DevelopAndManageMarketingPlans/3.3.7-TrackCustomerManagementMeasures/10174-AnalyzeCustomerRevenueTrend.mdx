# Analyze customer revenue trend

> Business-as-Code definition for customer revenue trend analysis. Models the examination of revenue patterns across customer segments to identify growth trajectories, seasonal variations, and revenue concentration risks.

## Overview

Analyzing the revenue stream generated by the sale of the organization's products/services in order to identify trends therein. Examine data relating to the inflow of revenue from individual/groups of customers in order to identify patterns in the generation and sustenance of receivables. Conduct statistical analysis over the stream of revenue collected and the point of origin associated with each unit of sale through metrics such as the accounting rate of return, the GAAP revenue over a given period, and customer lifetime revenue.
