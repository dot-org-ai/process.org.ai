# Develop and manage promotional activities

> Business-as-Code definition for promotional activity management. Models the lifecycle from concept definition and audience targeting through message development, campaign testing, execution, performance evaluation, and continuous optimization.

## Overview

Conceptualizing, testing, and executing product/service/brand promotions. Once a promotion has launched, this process continues as the organization tweaks parts of the promotion or chooses to use ideas or lessons learned during the promotion in future activities. The promotion's performance according to organizational measures is also evaluated in this process. Determine early on whether you need third party help with promotion. Purchase lists, consult with social media experts, hire seasonal staff, or pay for additional research.
