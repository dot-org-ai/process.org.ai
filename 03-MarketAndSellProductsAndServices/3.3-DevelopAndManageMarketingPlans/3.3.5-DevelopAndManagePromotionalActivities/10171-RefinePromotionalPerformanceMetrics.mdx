# Refine promotional performance metrics

> Business-as-Code definition for promotional metric refinement. Models the optimization of promotional activities by applying performance insights to adjust campaign parameters, messaging, and channel allocation for improved impact.

## Overview

Fine-tuning promotional activities by employing the insights gleaned from the quantitative, as well as any qualitative, performance evaluations. Change certain attributes of the schemes, campaigns, and programs deployed in order to increase the impact generated, in terms of measures already agreed upon such as customer uptake, market penetration, sustenance of impact created, and revenue growth through offerings marketed.
