# Develop and manage pricing

> Business-as-Code definition for pricing development and management. Models the complete pricing lifecycle from cost analysis and competitive review through pricing execution, performance evaluation, promotional pricing, and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

Determining and maintaining a pricing mechanism based on forecasted sales and that enables a pricing equilibrium for the lifecycles of products/services. Create a pricing mechanism, factoring in attributes relating to the market, customers, sales, and the cost of production. Implement this pricing mechanism over all products/services. Analyze its performance, and adjust accordingly.
