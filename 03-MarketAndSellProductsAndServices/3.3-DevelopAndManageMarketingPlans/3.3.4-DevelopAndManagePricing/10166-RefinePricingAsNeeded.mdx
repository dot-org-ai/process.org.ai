# Refine pricing as needed

> Business-as-Code definition for pricing refinement. Models the iterative adjustment of prices based on performance data, market conditions, and competitive dynamics to maximize profitability and customer uptake.

## Overview

Refining the pricing mechanism to create equitable prices for all products/services with the objective of maximizing the profits and/or customer uptake of these offerings. Reconcile the pricing mechanism in order to achieve equilibrium pricing. Adjust the prices for all of the organization's offerings, using the insights gleaned from examining how much profit or customer uptake is generated by the present pricing strategy.

const refinement = refinePricingAsNeeded()

// Model price adjustments for underperforming products
const model = await refinement.modelPriceAdjustments({
  products: ['starter-plan', 'team-plan'],
  adjustmentRange: { min: -0.10, max: 0.15 },
  targetMetric: 'contribution-margin',
  constraints: ['maintain-competitive-parity']
})

// Test proposed price changes in a regional pilot
const test = await refinement.testPriceChanges({
  adjustments: model.recommendations,
  testRegion: 'north-america',
  controlRegion: 'europe',
  duration: 30,
  successMetric: 'revenue-per-user'
