# Determine pricing based on volume/unit forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for volume-based pricing determination. Models the calculation of optimal price points using anticipated sales volumes, variable costs, and production economics.

## Overview

Establishing a dynamic pricing mechanism for the organization's offerings that is supported by the number of units in production. Outline a system for determining the optimum price point for each product/service. Based this model on an estimation of the volume of anticipated sales for each offering and variable costs.

const volumePricing = determinePricingBasedOnVolumeUnitForecast()

// Model price-volume relationship for a product line
const model = await volumePricing.modelPriceVolumeRelationship({
  productLine: 'enterprise-platform',
  volumeScenarios: [1000, 5000, 10000, 25000],
  variableCostPerUnit: 45.00,
  targetMargin: 0.65
})

// Define volume discount tiers
const tiers = await volumePricing.defineVolumeDiscountTiers({
  productId: 'SKU-1001',
  tiers: [
    { minUnits: 1, discount: 0 },
    { minUnits: 100, discount: 0.10 },
    { minUnits: 500, discount: 0.18 },
    { minUnits: 1000, discount: 0.25 }
