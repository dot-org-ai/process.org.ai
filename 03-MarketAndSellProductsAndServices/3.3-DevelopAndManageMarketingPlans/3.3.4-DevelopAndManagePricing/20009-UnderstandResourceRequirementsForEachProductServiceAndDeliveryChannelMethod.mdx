const costs = await resources.mapProductCosts({
  products: ['platform-standard', 'platform-enterprise', 'api-access'],
  costCategories: ['production', 'hosting', 'support', 'overhead']
})

// Analyze channel delivery costs
const channelCosts = await resources.analyzeChannelCosts({
  channels: ['direct-sales', 'partner', 'self-serve'],
  includeFixedCosts: true,
  volumeScenarios: [100, 1000, 10000]
