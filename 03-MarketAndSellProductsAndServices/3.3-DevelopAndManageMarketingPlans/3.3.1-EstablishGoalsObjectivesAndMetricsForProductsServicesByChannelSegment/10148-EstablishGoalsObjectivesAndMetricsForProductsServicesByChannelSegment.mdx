# Establish goals, objectives, and metrics for products/services by channel/segment

> Business-as-Code definition for marketing goal and metric establishment. Models the process of defining quantitative and qualitative performance targets for products and services across channels and customer segments.

## Overview

Determining what to achieve by marketing. Create qualitative and quantitative targets. Establish metrics to track performance (for individual Market segments [10109] and Channels for target segments [10129]). Enlist the head of marketing to determine marketing priorities and the related measures. (The decision in establishing these goals, objectives, and metrics is founded in Develop marketing strategy [10102] and takes cues from current priorities and organizational strategy.)
