# Plan packaging strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for product and service packaging strategy planning. Models the design of bundling, tiering, and presentation approaches that maximize perceived customer value while optimizing revenue and profitability.

## Overview

Creating a strategic road map for how to package products/services into desirable solutions while increasing profitability. Create a scheme for how the organization will bundle and wrap its products/services into a presentable and sellable offering. Consider what aspects or components of an offering the organization can extract the maximum revenue from, and reduce the less profitable constituents while maintaining a high perceptible value for the customers. Balance maximizing profit with benefits to the customer.

const packagingPlan = planPackagingStrategy()

// Define packaging tiers based on component analysis
const tiers = await packagingPlan.definePackagingTiers({

  tierCount: 3,
  differentiators: ['feature-access', 'usage-limits', 'support-level', 'sla'],
  targetSegments: ['starter', 'professional', 'enterprise']
})

// Model economic impact of proposed packaging
const economics = await packagingPlan.modelPackagingEconomics({
  tierStructure: tiers.id,
  projectionPeriod: '12-months',
  assumptions: { conversionRate: 0.03, upgradeRate: 0.15, churnReduction: 0.1 },
