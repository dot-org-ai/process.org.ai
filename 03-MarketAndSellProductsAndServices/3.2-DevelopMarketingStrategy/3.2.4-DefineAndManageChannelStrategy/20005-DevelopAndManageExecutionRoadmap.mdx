> Business-as-Code definition for multichannel execution roadmap development. Models the planning, sequencing, and governance of cross-channel marketing initiatives.

## Overview

Determining the actions that need to be taken for successful multichannel marketing, the ordering, timing and dependencies of the steps, and the governance mechanism for reviewing and changing the protocol, if needed.
