# Determine channels to be supported

> Business-as-Code definition for channel support determination. Models the decision process for identifying which distribution and marketing channels the organization will invest in and maintain.

## Overview

Deciding which distributors, wholesalers and retailers the company will use to promote its offerings and to distribute its products and services to the target market. Narrowing down which intermediaries the company will use will affect retail prices of individual products, and should therefore be included in the pricing analysis.
