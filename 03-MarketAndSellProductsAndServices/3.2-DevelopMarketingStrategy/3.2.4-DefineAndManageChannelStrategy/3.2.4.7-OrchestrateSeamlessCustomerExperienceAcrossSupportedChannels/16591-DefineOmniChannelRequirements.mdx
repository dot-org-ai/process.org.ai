> Business-as-Code definition for omni-channel requirement specification. Models the identification and documentation of preconditions channels must meet for inclusion in the omni-channel network.

## Overview

Identifying necessary preconditions that a channel should fulfill in order to be included as one of the adopted channels, such as required throughput capacities, service capabilities, competitive pricing, and alignment with organizational marketing strategies.

  minTransactionsPerSecond: 500,
  peakLoadMultiplier: 3.0
})

// Set integration standards for cross-channel data flow
const standards = await requirements.setIntegrationStandards({
  dataFormat: 'JSON',
  syncMode: 'real-time',
  maxLatencyMs: 200
})
