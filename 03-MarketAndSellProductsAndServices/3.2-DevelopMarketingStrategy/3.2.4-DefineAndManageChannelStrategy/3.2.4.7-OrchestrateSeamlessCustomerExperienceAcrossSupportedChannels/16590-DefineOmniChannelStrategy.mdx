# Define omni-channel strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for omni-channel strategy formulation. Models the design of a unified cross-channel approach that enables seamless customer interactions across all supported touchpoints.

## Overview

Devising a strategy to market company's products or services seamlessly through all or most channels that are in widespread use among the target market. This may mean cross-channel access to customer preferences and purchasing history to accept returned merchandise, provide refunds, resolve payment issues or to provide technical support.
