# Establish guidelines for applying pricing and discounting of products/services

> Business-as-Code definition for pricing and discounting guideline creation. Models the development of uniform pricing frameworks that balance cost structures, competitive positioning, and discount governance.

## Overview

Creating a framework that allows for a uniform methodology while determining the price of individual offerings. Devise a blueprint for establishing the pricing of specific products/services. Create guidelines that factor in the cost of production/servicing, price sensitivity, product lifecycle, and the price of competing/substitute products.
