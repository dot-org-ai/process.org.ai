> Business-as-Code definition for pricing analysis execution. Models the systematic evaluation of costs, demand elasticity, competitor pricing, and market conditions to determine optimal price points.

## Overview

Analyzing marketing objectives, consumer demand, product attributes, competitors' pricing, and economic trends to determine optimum prices for the set of products and services that the company offers or intends to offer by delivering maximum ROI.
