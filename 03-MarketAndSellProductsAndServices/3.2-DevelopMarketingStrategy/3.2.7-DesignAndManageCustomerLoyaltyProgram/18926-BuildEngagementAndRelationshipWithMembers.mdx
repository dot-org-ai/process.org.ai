# Build engagement and relationship with members

> Business-as-Code definition for loyalty member engagement and relationship building. Models the programs and interactions that deepen customer-brand relationships, drive repeat purchases, and foster advocacy.

## Overview

Besides making frequent purchases, highly engaged customers refer family, friends and colleagues to make purchases as well, consume and re-broadcast promotional materials, provide feedback to the purchases they make and do not support competing brands.
