# Define direct marketing strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for direct marketing strategy formulation. Models the planning of one-to-one customer outreach including audience selection, offer personalization, and channel optimization.

## Overview

Devising a master plan how to select potential customers or qualified clients for customized offers, and contact them on one-to-one basis through chat, phone, email or regular mail. The strategy would need to take into account that personalizing offers and contacting customers individually is an effective but resource-intensive marketing technique, and that ill-targeted offers risk at angering and alienating the contactees.
