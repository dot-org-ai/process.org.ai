# Define communication guidelines and mechanisms

> Business-as-Code definition for communication guidelines and mechanisms. Models the establishment of standards governing marketing message creation, audience targeting, and channel selection.

## Overview

Establishing standardized procedures for effective communication that maximizes ROI, promotes brand awareness and respects customers. In its simplest form, it includes a message (what is to be said), a target (to whom the message is reaching) and a medium or a channel (where the message is to be said).
