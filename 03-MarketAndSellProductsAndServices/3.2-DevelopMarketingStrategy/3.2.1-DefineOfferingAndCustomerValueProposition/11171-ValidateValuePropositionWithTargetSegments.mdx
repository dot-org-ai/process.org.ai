# Validate value proposition with target segments

> Business-as-Code definition for value proposition validation. Models the testing and confirmation of value propositions through customer feedback, demonstrations, surveys, and research to ensure alignment with target segment expectations.

## Overview

Substantiate the value of the benefits accrued to the customers through the organization's offerings. Justify the value proposition in light of the targeted segments by gathering feedback (using teaser demonstrations, surveys, interviews, primary research studies, and customer case studies). Corroborate the benefits of the organization's offerings.
