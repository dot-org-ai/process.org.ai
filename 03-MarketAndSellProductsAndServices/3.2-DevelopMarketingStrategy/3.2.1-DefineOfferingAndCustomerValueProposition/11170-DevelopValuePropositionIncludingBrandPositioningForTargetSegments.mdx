# Develop value proposition including brand positioning for target segments

> Business-as-Code definition for value proposition and brand positioning development. Models the identification of segment-specific value drivers, articulation of customer benefits, and creation of brand positioning that reinforces offering attractiveness for each target segment.

## Overview

Boosting the attractiveness of products/services to the targeted customers, and creating a unique brand projection around these features. Identify and enhance those product/service features that reinforce the attractiveness of these offerings, for these segment of customers. Underscore the perceived value delivered to the customers by clearly specifying the relevance and desirability of these products/services. Once it has been clarified how the organization's offerings meet the customer's expectations or deliver specific benefits, position the brands around these benefits.
