# Analyze performance

> Business-as-Code definition for channel performance analysis. Models the in-depth review of channel results against established metrics, historical baselines, and forecast targets.

## Overview

Conducting an analysis to review channel performance with respect to chosen metrics, benchmarks and performance targets [16573]. Compare to past performance and forecasts for the channel.

const analysis = analyzePerformance()

// Compare current results against targets
const comparison = await analysis.compareToTargets({
  channels: ['paid-search', 'social', 'email'],
  period: 'Q4-2024',
  metrics: ['revenue', 'conversion-rate', 'cac']
})

// Identify root causes for underperformance
const rootCauses = await analysis.identifyRootCauses({
  channel: 'paid-search',
  metric: 'conversion-rate',
  analysisDepth: 'comprehensive'
})
```
