# Establish channel-specific metrics and targets

> Business-as-Code definition for channel metrics and target establishment. Models the definition of performance benchmarks, KPIs, and goal-setting for individual marketing channels.

## Overview

Determining measurable parameters to be used for comparing the performance of different marketing channels. Decide on benchmarks and values for optimum or desired performance.

const metrics = establishChannelSpecificMetricsAndTargets()

// Define metrics for a channel
const channelMetrics = await metrics.defineChannelMetrics({
  channel: 'paid-search',
  metrics: ['cpc', 'ctr', 'conversion-rate', 'roas']
})

// Assign performance targets
const targets = await metrics.assignPerformanceTargets({
  channel: 'paid-search',
  targets: { cpc: 2.50, ctr: 0.03, conversionRate: 0.05, roas: 4.0 }
})
```
