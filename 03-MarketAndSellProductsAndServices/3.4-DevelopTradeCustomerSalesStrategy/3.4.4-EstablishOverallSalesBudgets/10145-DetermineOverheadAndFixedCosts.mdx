# Determine overhead and fixed costs

> Business-as-Code definition for overhead and fixed cost determination. Models the identification and calculation of costs that remain constant regardless of sales volume, including facilities, salaries, and equipment.

## Overview

Calculating the overhead costs associated with selling the organization's products/services. Determine fixed costs that are not directly related to the volume of products/services processed or the sale of these offerings (e.g., expense over machinery and equipment).

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyFixedCostCategories | Catalog all costs that do not vary with production or sales volume |
| calculateOverheadRates | Determine overhead allocation rates for facilities, equipment, and admin |
| allocateCostsToProducts | Distribute fixed and overhead costs across product lines using allocation basis |
| projectAnnualFixedCosts | Estimate total fixed costs for the budget period |

const overhead = determineOverheadAndFixedCosts()

// Identify fixed cost categories
const categories = await overhead.identifyFixedCostCategories({
  departments: ['sales', 'marketing', 'operations'],
  includeDepreciation: true
})

// Project annual fixed costs
const fixedCosts = await overhead.projectAnnualFixedCosts({
  categories: categories.map(c => c.id),
  period: 'fiscal-year-2026',
  adjustForInflation: true
})
