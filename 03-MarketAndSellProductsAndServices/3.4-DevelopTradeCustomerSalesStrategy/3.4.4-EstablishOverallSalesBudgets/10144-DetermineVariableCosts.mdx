# Determine variable costs

> Business-as-Code definition for variable cost determination. Models the calculation of costs that fluctuate with production and sales volume, including materials, commissions, and transaction fees.

## Overview

Calculating the variable costs of production. Approximate those costs that depend on the volume of products/services produced by the organization.

    B --> C[Identify cost components]
    B --> D[Calculate per-unit costs]
    B --> E[Project total variable costs]

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
determine:
  object: Variable Costs
  actor: FinancialPlanningAnalyst
  result: VariableCostProjection
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyCostComponents | Catalog all cost elements that vary with production or sales volume |
| calculatePerUnitCosts | Determine the variable cost per unit for each product or service |
| projectTotalVariableCosts | Multiply per-unit costs by forecasted volumes to get total variable costs |
| analyzeVariableCostTrends | Track changes in variable cost rates over time |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| costComponentsIdentified | Variable cost elements cataloged for all products |
| perUnitCostsCalculated | Per-unit variable costs determined by product |
| totalVariableCostsProjected | Total variable cost projections completed |
| variableCostTrendsAnalyzed | Cost rate trends documented and reported |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getVariableCosts | Retrieve variable cost data by product or cost component |
| getPerUnitCost | Access per-unit variable cost for a specific product |
| getCostTrends | Query variable cost trends over time |

## Usage

```typescript
import { determineVariableCosts } from '@headlessly/determine-variable-costs'

const costs = determineVariableCosts()

// Calculate per-unit costs
const unitCosts = await costs.calculatePerUnitCosts({
  products: ['platform-standard', 'platform-enterprise'],
  components: ['hosting', 'support', 'commissions', 'payment-processing']
})

// Project total variable costs
const projection = await costs.projectTotalVariableCosts({
  costModel: unitCosts.id,
  forecastedVolumes: { 'platform-standard': 10000, 'platform-enterprise': 2000 }
})
```
