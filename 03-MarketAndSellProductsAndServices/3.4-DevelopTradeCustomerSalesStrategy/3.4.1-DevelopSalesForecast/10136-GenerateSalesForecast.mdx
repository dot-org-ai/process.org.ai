# Generate sales forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for sales forecast generation. Models the creation of demand projections using statistical methods, pipeline data, and judgmental inputs to estimate future sales across products, territories, and time horizons.

## Overview

Calculating the future demand for the organization's products/services. Use the trends and patterns identified in the sales data to estimate future demand. Use forecast to prepare for future customer demand and to recalibrate the strategic course of functions and business units.

  includePromotionalEffects: true
})

// Run demand scenarios
const scenarios = await forecast.runForecastScenarios({
