# Analyze sales trends and patterns

> Business-as-Code definition for sales trend and pattern analysis. Models the examination of historical sales order data to identify demand patterns, seasonal cycles, segment growth trajectories, and anomalies that inform forecasting.

## Overview

Analyzing sales order data to identify patterns in order to capitalize on emerging trends in the industry or the economy. Closely examine the directory of sales orders. Discern any patterns from this index, which is representative of the demand for the organization's offerings. Identify trends among the various segments of the organization's customer base to create forecasts. Glean patterns from this analysis, including the triangulation of segments that are showing the most growth in demand or those that represent the highest decline revenue, industry-wide trends such as decline/boost in overall demand, and any unusual trends that lie outside of the organization's expectations.
