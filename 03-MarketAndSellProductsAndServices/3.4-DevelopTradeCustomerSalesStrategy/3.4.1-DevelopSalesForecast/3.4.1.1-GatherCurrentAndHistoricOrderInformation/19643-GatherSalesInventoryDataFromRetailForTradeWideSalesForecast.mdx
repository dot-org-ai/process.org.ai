# Gather sales/inventory data from retail for trade wide sales forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for retail sales and inventory data collection. Models the aggregation of sell-through volumes, on-hand inventory levels, and replenishment data from retail partners to build a trade-wide demand picture for forecasting.

## Overview

Collecting sales transaction and inventory position data from retail partners to construct a trade-wide view of product demand. Aggregate sell-through volumes, weeks of supply, stock-out frequency, and replenishment rates across retail channels. This consolidated dataset enables trade-wide sales forecasting by revealing true consumer demand beyond what internal shipment data alone can show.
