# Identify brand and portfolio gaps

> Business-as-Code definition for brand and product portfolio gap analysis. Models the systematic mapping of product portfolios against market demand to identify unmet customer needs and brand coverage gaps.

## Overview

Analyzing the current brand architecture and product portfolio to detect gaps where customer needs are not being addressed. Mapping existing offerings against market segments, price tiers, and use cases to find whitespace opportunities for new products, brand extensions, or portfolio rationalization.
