# Study customer segmentation patterns (e.g. by performing data driven segmentation analysis)

> Business-as-Code definition for data-driven customer segmentation analysis. Models the clustering and profiling of customer populations using behavioral, demographic, and transactional data to identify distinct market segments.

## Overview

Analyzing customer data to identify distinct segmentation patterns using statistical and machine learning techniques. Performing cluster analysis on customer demographics, purchase behavior, engagement metrics, and psychographic attributes to create actionable customer segments for targeted marketing and product development.

## Usage

```typescript
import { studyCustomerSegmentationPatterns } from '@headlessly/study-customer-segmentation-patterns'

const segmentation = studyCustomerSegmentationPatterns()

// Run cluster analysis on customer base
const model = await segmentation.performClusterAnalysis({
  features: ['recency', 'frequency', 'monetaryValue', 'engagement'],
  algorithm: 'k-means',
  maxClusters: 8
})

// Get detailed profile for a specific segment
const profile = await segmentation.profileSegments({
  segmentId: model.segments[0].id,
  includeJourney: true
})
```
