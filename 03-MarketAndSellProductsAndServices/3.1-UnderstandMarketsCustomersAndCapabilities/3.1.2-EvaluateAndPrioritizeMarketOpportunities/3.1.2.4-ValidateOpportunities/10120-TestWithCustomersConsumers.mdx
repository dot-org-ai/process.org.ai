# Test with customers/consumers

> Business-as-Code definition for customer validation testing. Models the design and execution of concept tests, pilot programs, and limited-scale market trials to validate opportunity demand before full-scale commitment.

## Overview

Validating identified market opportunities by testing company's offerings on limited-size samples of the consumer population that are hypothesized to be representative of the target market at large and to have similar purchasing behavior. The feedback gained through consumer testing can be used to modify or reject product offerings before their full scale launch, saving the company valuable resources, should the initial offering not be successful.
