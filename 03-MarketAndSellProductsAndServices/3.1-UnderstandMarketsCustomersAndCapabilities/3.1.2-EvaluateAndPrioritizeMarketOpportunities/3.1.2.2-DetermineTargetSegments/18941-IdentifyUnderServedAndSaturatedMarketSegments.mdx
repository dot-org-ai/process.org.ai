# Identify under-served and saturated market segments

> Business-as-Code definition for under-served and saturated segment identification. Models the analysis of market penetration levels to distinguish high-opportunity segments from those with diminishing returns.

## Overview

Determining which groups of potential customers do not yet, or already do have access to the product or a service that the company produces or markets. Use those findings to create specialized product offerings and differentiated marketing campaigns.

const saturation = identifyUnderServedAndSaturatedMarketSegments()

// Measure penetration levels across segments
const penetration = await saturation.measurePenetrationLevels({
  market: 'Cloud Infrastructure',
  segments: ['startup', 'smb', 'mid-market', 'enterprise', 'government']
})

// Estimate revenue potential in under-served segments
const whitespace = await saturation.estimateWhitespaceValue({
  classification: 'under-served',
  minPotential: 50000000
})
