# Forecast vehicle build and create build plan

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for forecast vehicle build and create build plan (automotive)

## Overview

This process group defines the parameters needed to create a build plan and includes the capacities, constraints and calendars against which sales orders can be matched. Production is strategized and planned and forecasting is conducted to support manufacturing planning. Thereafter, plant resource and safety planning is undertaken, manufacturing targets are set, manufacturing is planned and simulated (which helps to define outline purchase orders etc.) and production rules and policies are determined.
