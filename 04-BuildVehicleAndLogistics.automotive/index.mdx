# Build Vehicle and logistics

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for build vehicle and logistics (automotive)

## Overview

This process includes the production, inventory management, retailing and distribution processes executed in the supply chain of an OEM. It begins once the planning, design and prototyping stages of the supply chain described by the processes “new vehicle development” are complete. The first process group covers the forecasting of the vehicle build and creation of the corresponding build plan and progresses to validating quality targets, creating production orders and procuring the required materials and services. Thereafter, the vehicle is manufactured; logistics, warehousing and distribution are planned and managed; and production is monitored.
