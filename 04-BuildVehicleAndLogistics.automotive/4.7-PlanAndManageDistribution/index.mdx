# Plan and manage distribution

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for plan and manage distribution (automotive)

## Overview

This process group is executed upon the completion of production and addresses the allocation/distribution of stock or customer orders according to the latest view of incoming demand. This entails planning distribution requirements, establishing distribution planning constraints, reviewing distribution planning policies and assessing the performance of distribution planning. Please note that dealers and retailers distribute the vehicles to customers. Before a vehicle is distributed to customers, service technicians and advisors are trained to service the vehicle and sales assistants are given accurate and reliable product information so they can sell the vehicle and answer any questions that a customer may have. These processes are covered in “manage customer service”.
