# Manage remediation efforts

> Business-as-Code definition for planning, resourcing, and executing corrective actions to address compliance gaps, risk events, audit findings, and environmental or operational damage through structured remediation programs.

## Overview

Administering the efforts and activities for remediation. This process element requires the organization to create plans for corrective action in collaboration with government agencies and pertinent professional services agencies which specialize in remediation efforts relevant to the organization's operations. Additionally, the organization needs to consult experts to validate the plan, determine resources allocation, resolve any legal concerns, and formulate a company-wide policy for remediation.
