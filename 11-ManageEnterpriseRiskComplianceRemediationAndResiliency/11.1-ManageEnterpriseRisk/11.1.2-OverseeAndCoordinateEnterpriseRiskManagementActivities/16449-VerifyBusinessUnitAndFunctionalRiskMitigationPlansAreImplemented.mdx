# Verify business unit and functional risk mitigation plans are implemented

> Business-as-Code definition for validating that approved risk mitigation plans are correctly implemented across all business units and functional areas.

## Overview

Checking that the blueprint created for managing risk in individual business units and divisions is correctly effectuated. Validate the implementation of all activities geared to mitigate risks.
