# Assess risks to determine which to mitigate

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating identified enterprise risks using quantitative and qualitative methods to prioritize which risks require active mitigation.

## Overview

Identifying options/actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats. Recognize the root reasons of the identified risks.

// Score risk likelihood and impact
const scored = await assessment.scoreRiskLikelihood({
  riskId: 'RISK-2026-042',
  likelihood: 0.35,
  confidenceLevel: 'medium'
})

// Generate risk heat map
const heatMap = await assessment.generateRiskHeatMap({
  scope: 'enterprise',
