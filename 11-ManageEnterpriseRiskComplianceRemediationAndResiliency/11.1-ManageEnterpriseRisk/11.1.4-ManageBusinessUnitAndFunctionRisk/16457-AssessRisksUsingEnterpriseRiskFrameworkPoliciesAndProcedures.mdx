# Assess risks using enterprise risk framework policies and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating identified business unit risks using the organization's established risk framework, policies, and standardized assessment procedures.

## Overview

Determining the possibility that a specified undesirable event will occur using established tools, implements, and frameworks. Use risk assessments to determine, for example, whether to undertake a particular venture, what rate of return a particular investment requires, and how to mitigate an activity's potential losses.

const result = await assessment.applyRiskFramework({
  riskId: 'BU-RISK-2026-018',
  frameworkVersion: 'v3.2',
  assessor: 'risk-analyst-ops'
