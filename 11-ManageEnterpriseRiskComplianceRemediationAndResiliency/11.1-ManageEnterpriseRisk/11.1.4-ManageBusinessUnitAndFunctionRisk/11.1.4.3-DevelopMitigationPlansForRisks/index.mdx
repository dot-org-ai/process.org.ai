| estimateMitigationCosts | Calculate the cost of implementing mitigation activities |
| assignMitigationOwnership | Designate responsible parties for each mitigation activity |
| approveMitigationPlan | Obtain management approval for the proposed mitigation plan |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| mitigationStrategySelected | Risk response strategy chosen for identified risk |
| controlMeasuresDesigned | Specific controls and safeguards defined |
| mitigationCostsEstimated | Implementation cost estimates completed |
| mitigationOwnershipAssigned | Responsible parties designated for mitigation activities |
| mitigationPlanApproved | Mitigation plan approved by management |

## Usage

```typescript
import { developMitigationPlansForRisks } from '@headlessly/develop-mitigation-plans-for-risks'

const mitigation = developMitigationPlansForRisks()

// Select a mitigation strategy for a risk
const strategy = await mitigation.selectMitigationStrategy({
  riskId: 'BU-RISK-2026-018',
  options: ['avoidance', 'reduction', 'transfer', 'acceptance'],
  costConstraint: 500000
})

// Design control measures
const controls = await mitigation.designControlMeasures({
  riskId: 'BU-RISK-2026-018',
  strategy: strategy.selectedApproach,
  targetResidualRisk: 'low'
})
```
