  participants: ['operations-manager', 'procurement-lead', 'logistics-coordinator'],
  scope: ['supplier-risks', 'transportation-risks', 'inventory-risks']
})

// Catalog a newly identified risk
const newRisk = await risks.catalogNewRisks({
  title: 'Single-source supplier dependency',
  category: 'operational',
  process: 'procurement',
  initialLikelihood: 'medium',
  initialImpact: 'high'
})
