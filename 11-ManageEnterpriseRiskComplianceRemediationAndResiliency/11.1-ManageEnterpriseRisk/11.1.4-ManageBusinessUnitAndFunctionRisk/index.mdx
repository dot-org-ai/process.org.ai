> Business-as-Code definition for identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting on risks at the business unit and functional level using the enterprise risk framework and standardized procedures.

## Overview

Analyzing the threats a business unit/function faces to prioritize the controls it implements..

const risks = await risk.identifyRisks({
  businessUnit: 'Manufacturing-West',
  categories: ['operational', 'supply-chain', 'safety'],
  assessmentDate: '2025-07-01'
