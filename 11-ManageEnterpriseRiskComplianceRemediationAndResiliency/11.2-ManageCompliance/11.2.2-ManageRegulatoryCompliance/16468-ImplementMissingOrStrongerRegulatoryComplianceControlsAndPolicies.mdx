# Implement missing or stronger regulatory compliance controls and policies

> Business-as-Code definition for deploying new or enhanced compliance controls and policies to address identified regulatory gaps and strengthen the organization's compliance posture.

## Overview

Assessing the current policies and policies. Implement missing and necessary changes environmental changes, political changes, technological changes, etc.

  controlType: 'preventive',
  regulation: 'GDPR-Article-17',
  description: 'Automated data deletion request processing'
