# Manage business resiliency

> Business-as-Code definition for developing, testing, and maintaining the organization's ability to rapidly adapt and respond to disruptions, ensuring continuous business operations and knowledge sharing of risk-related insights across the enterprise.

## Overview

Including the processes required to rapidly adapt and respond to any internal or external opportunity, demand, disruption, or threat. Develop a more dynamic, strategic, and integrated approach to managing compliance obligations.
