# Test continuous business operations

> Business-as-Code definition for validating business continuity plans through structured exercises, drills, and simulations to ensure the organization can maintain operations during disruptions.

## Overview

Assessing ongoing activities within the organization that are not intended to stop except for in an emergency.

  targetFunctions: ['order-processing', 'customer-support'],
  simulationLevel: 'full-scale',
  expectedDuration: '4-hours'
