# Negotiate offer

> Business-as-Code definition for negotiating employment offers. Models the back-and-forth dialogue between the candidate and organization to reach mutually agreeable terms on compensation, benefits, start date, remote work, and other employment conditions.

## Overview

Negotiating an offer with selected candidates. Discuss the job offer with the candidate to ensure a mutual understanding. Address candidate counter-proposals on salary, equity, sign-on bonus, relocation, start date, and flexible work arrangements while staying within approved compensation bands and budget constraints.
