# Identify and deploy candidate selection tools

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying and deploying candidate selection tools. Models the evaluation, procurement, configuration, and rollout of screening instruments including resume parsers, pre-employment assessments, background check services, and AI-powered candidate matching systems.

## Overview

Identifying and implementing tools for the selection of candidates. Recognize candidate selection tools such as screening, telephone interviews, hiring manager interviews, drug testing, and skills assessment. Effectively deploy these tools to check if the candidates fit in the workplace or not, as well as to ensure workplace safety.
