# Align learning programs with competencies

> Business-as-Code definition for aligning learning programs with competencies. Models the process of mapping organizational training offerings to defined competency frameworks so that every course, module, and learning path directly addresses a specific skill or knowledge gap.

## Overview

Aligning the learning programs with the core capabilities and competencies of the organization. Map each training offering to specific competency domains and proficiency levels. Identify coverage gaps where no learning program addresses a required competency, and eliminate redundant offerings that overlap without adding value. Contextualize training so employees can expand their knowledge base along defined career progression paths aligned with organizational competency models.

// Map all active programs to competency domains
const matrix = await alignment.mapProgramsToCompetencies({
  competencyFrameworkId: 'enterprise-competency-model-v3',
  programCatalog: 'active',
  includeExternalProviders: true
})

// Identify competencies with no learning coverage
const gaps = await alignment.identifyCoverageGaps({
  frameworkId: 'enterprise-competency-model-v3',
  minimumProficiencyLevel: 3,
  businessUnit: 'engineering'
})
