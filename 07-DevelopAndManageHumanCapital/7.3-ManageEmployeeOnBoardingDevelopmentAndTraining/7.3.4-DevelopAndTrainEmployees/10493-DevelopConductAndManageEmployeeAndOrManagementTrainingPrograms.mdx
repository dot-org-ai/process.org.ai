# Develop, conduct, and manage employee and/or management training programs

> Business-as-Code definition for developing, conducting, and managing employee and management training programs. Models the end-to-end lifecycle of designing training curricula, sourcing delivery resources, delivering sessions across multiple formats, and administering program logistics for technical, interpersonal, and leadership development tracks.

## Overview

Creating, implementing, and managing the programs for training employees. Design course curricula based on established skills gaps and competency alignment data. Source internal facilitators and external vendors for specialized content areas. Conduct sessions through classroom, virtual, blended, and self-paced formats.
