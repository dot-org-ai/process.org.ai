# Establish training needs by analysis of required and available skills

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing training needs through skills gap analysis. Models the end-to-end process of inventorying required skills, assessing current workforce capabilities, quantifying gaps, and translating those gaps into prioritized training requirements.

## Overview

Determining the training necessitated by business processes, using an examination of skill sets that are needed by the organization and those already possessed. Catalog the skills and proficiency levels required for each role. Assess current employee capabilities through self-assessments, manager evaluations, and competency testing. Quantify the gap between required and available skills. Prioritize training needs based on business impact, urgency, and resource availability. Design training recommendations in light of the availability of resources to provide specific segments of training.
