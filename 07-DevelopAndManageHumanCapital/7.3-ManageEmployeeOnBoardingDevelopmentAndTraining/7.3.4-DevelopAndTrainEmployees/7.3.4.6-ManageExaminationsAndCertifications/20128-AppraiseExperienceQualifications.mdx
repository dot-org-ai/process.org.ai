# Appraise experience qualifications

> Business-as-Code definition for appraising experience qualifications. Models the process of evaluating whether candidates possess the practical work experience required to qualify for specific certifications or roles, verifying documented experience against established criteria.

## Overview

Ascertaining the experience level needed to qualify for a specific job or certification within the organization. Many certifications require documented practical experience in addition to training program completion and exam passage. Review candidate work history, project portfolios, and supervisor attestations against certification authority experience requirements. Evaluate the relevance, depth, and duration of experience claimed. Issue experience verification letters or approve experience documentation for submission to certification authorities. Identify experience gaps and recommend supervised practice or mentorship to meet requirements.
