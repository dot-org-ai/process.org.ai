# Define employee competencies

> Business-as-Code definition for defining employee competencies. Models the process of identifying, articulating, and structuring the skills, knowledge, abilities, and behavioral attributes required for each role, forming the competency framework that underpins talent development, performance management, and succession planning.

## Overview

Defining the skills, knowledge, abilities, and attributes needed to carry out a specific job. Analyze each role to identify functional, technical, and behavioral competencies required at various proficiency levels. Structure competencies into a hierarchical framework organized by competency domains, clusters, and individual competency elements. Establish proficiency level descriptors (e.g., foundational, proficient, advanced, expert) for each competency. Validate the framework with subject matter experts and business leaders. Publish the competency model for use in hiring, development, performance evaluation, and career pathing.
