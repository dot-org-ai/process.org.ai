# Develop and manage employee metrics

> Business-as-Code definition for developing and managing employee metrics. Models the complete process of defining, calculating, benchmarking, and maintaining strategic workforce KPIs that drive data-informed HR decisions across the organization.

## Overview

Creating and maintaining performance metrics for employees. Create and manage a strategic system of data and statistics to accurately gauge each employee's information. Consider productivity metrics, efficiency metrics, training metrics, etc. Define metric formulas and data sources, establish benchmarks and targets, automate calculation pipelines, and publish workforce scorecards that inform talent, retention, and organizational effectiveness decisions.

const metrics = developEmployeeMetrics()

// Retrieve turnover metric values with benchmark comparison
const turnover = await metrics.getBenchmarkComparisons({
  metricId: 'voluntary-turnover-rate',
  department: 'engineering',
  period: '2025',
  benchmarkSource: 'radford-technology-survey'
})

// Automate calculation pipeline for a new metric
const pipeline = await metrics.automateMetricCalculation({
  metricId: 'time-to-productivity',
  formula: 'avg(days_to_full_performance)',
  dataSources: ['hris', 'performance-management'],
  refreshCadence: 'monthly',
  effectiveDate: '2026-03-01'
})
