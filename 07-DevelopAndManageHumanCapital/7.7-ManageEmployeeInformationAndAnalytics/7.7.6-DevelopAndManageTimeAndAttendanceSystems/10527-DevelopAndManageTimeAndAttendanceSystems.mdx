# Develop and manage time and attendance systems

> Business-as-Code definition for developing and managing time and attendance systems. Models the complete process of selecting, configuring, deploying, and maintaining systems that track employee work hours, attendance, breaks, and labor allocation.

## Overview

Developing and maintaining systems for managing the time and attendance of employees. Routinely upgrade the process and systems that track when employees start and stop work, the department where the work is performed, attendance in addition to tracking meals and breaks, the type of work performed, and the number of items produced. Ensure compliance with wage and hour regulations, integrate time data with payroll processing, and provide labor cost analytics to management.
