# Manage human resource information systems (HRIS)

> Business-as-Code definition for managing human resource information systems. Models the complete process of administering, configuring, integrating, and maintaining HRIS platforms that support HR, payroll, benefits, and talent management operations.

## Overview

Administering and maintaining HR information systems that take care of activities related to HR, accounting, management, and payroll. Configure system modules, manage user access and roles, maintain integrations with payroll, benefits, and talent systems, apply patches and upgrades, and ensure system performance, security, and data integrity across the HR technology stack.

// Check integration health for all active HRIS data feeds
const integrations = await hris.getIntegrationStatus({
  status: 'active',
  includeLastSyncTimestamp: true,
  includeErrorCounts: true
})

// Provision a new HRIS user with benefits administrator role
const access = await hris.manageUserAccessRoles({
  userId: 'USR-9021',
  action: 'provision',
  role: 'benefits-administrator',
  modules: ['benefits', 'open-enrollment'],
