# Manage/Collect employee suggestions and perform employee research

> Business-as-Code definition for managing employee suggestion programs and conducting employee research. Models the process of collecting, evaluating, and implementing employee ideas while using surveys, focus groups, and data analysis to understand workforce attitudes and engagement.

## Overview

Procuring and handling suggestions from employees, and performing research on employees. Manage and analyze the programs that help the organization to tap into employee ideas for improving the organization's processes and/or products. Use surveys, focus groups, and other data-gathering methods to find out the attitudes, opinions, and feelings of members of an organization. Score and prioritize ideas by feasibility and business impact, close the loop with submitters, and feed insights into organizational improvement initiatives.
