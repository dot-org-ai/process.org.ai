# Develop employee communication plan

> Business-as-Code definition for developing an employee communication plan. Models the complete process of designing a structured communication strategy that aligns messaging, channels, cadence, and stakeholder involvement to inform, engage, and empower employees during organizational change and steady-state operations.

## Overview

Creating a plan for managing communication among employees. Inform employees of direction. Counter resistance with change management approaches. Seek specific areas of input to the decision-making process. Seek varying degrees of involvement and co-creation. Define target audiences, select communication channels, establish messaging cadence, assign content ownership, and build feedback mechanisms to ensure two-way dialogue.
