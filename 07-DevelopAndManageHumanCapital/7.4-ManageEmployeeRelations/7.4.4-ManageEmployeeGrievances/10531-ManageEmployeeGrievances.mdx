# Manage employee grievances

> Business-as-Code definition for managing employee grievances. Models the end-to-end process of receiving, investigating, mediating, and resolving formal employee complaints through procedures established in collective agreements, employment contracts, or organizational policy.

## Overview

Taking care of or resolving any complaint raised by an employee by procedures provided for in a collective agreement, an employment contract, or by other mechanisms established by an employer. Receive and acknowledge formal grievance filings within required timeframes. Investigate grievance claims through witness interviews, document review, and site inspections. Facilitate mediation sessions between the grievant, their representative, and management. Render formal written decisions at each step of the grievance procedure. Process appeals and escalations through successive management levels. Coordinate with legal counsel on grievances that proceed to arbitration. Document all resolutions, corrective actions, and precedent-setting outcomes for future reference.
