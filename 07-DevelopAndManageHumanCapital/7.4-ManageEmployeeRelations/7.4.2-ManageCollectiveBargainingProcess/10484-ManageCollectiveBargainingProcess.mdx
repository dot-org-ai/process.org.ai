# Manage collective bargaining process

> Business-as-Code definition for managing the collective bargaining process. Models the end-to-end negotiation lifecycle between employer and union representatives, from pre-bargaining preparation through contract ratification and implementation.

## Overview

Managing negotiations between an employer and a group of employees that determine the conditions of employment. Prepare for bargaining by analyzing current contract costs, surveying industry compensation trends, and developing management proposals. Engage employee representatives to reach agreements on wages, hours, benefits, working conditions, and dispute resolution procedures. Manage the negotiation timeline, counter-proposal exchanges, and tentative agreement packages. Facilitate ratification voting and communicate new contract terms to the workforce. Coordinate contract implementation across all affected departments and systems.
