const implementation = implementWorkforceStrategyModels()

// Build phased rollout plan for approved strategy model
const rollout = await implementation.buildRolloutPlan({
  modelId: 'workforce-strategy-2026',
  phases: [
    { units: ['Engineering', 'Product'], startWeek: 1 },
    { units: ['Sales', 'Marketing'], startWeek: 6 },
    { units: ['Operations', 'Finance'], startWeek: 10 }
  ],
  changeReadinessThreshold: 0.7
})

// Track adoption milestones across deployed units
const adoption = await implementation.trackAdoptionMilestones({
  deploymentId: rollout.id,
  metrics: ['usage-frequency', 'process-compliance', 'manager-feedback'],
  reportingCadence: 'bi-weekly'
})
