# Develop workforce strategy models

> Business-as-Code definition for developing workforce strategy models. Models the analytical frameworks, simulation tools, and strategic blueprints that drive long-term workforce planning and optimization.

## Overview

Creating and implementing models for effectively strategizing the work force of the organization. Develop a model that specifies the organization's overall approach for maximizing the performance of its work force by defining the goals, objectives, and expectations of the work force. Manage all aspects of performance required for the work force to function, including recruitment, selection, retention, and professional development.

const strategy = developWorkforceStrategyModels()

// Translate corporate strategy into workforce capability requirements
const requirements = await strategy.translateCorporateStrategy({
  corporateStrategy: 'growth-acceleration',
  planningHorizon: '5-year',
  focusAreas: ['digital-transformation', 'market-expansion', 'ai-adoption']
})

// Run scenario simulations with varying assumptions
const results = await strategy.runScenarioSimulations({
  demandModelId: requirements.demandForecastId,
  scenarios: [
    { name: 'high-attrition', attritionRate: 0.22, automationFactor: 0.15 },
    { name: 'rapid-growth', revenueGrowth: 0.35, hiringRamp: 'aggressive' },
    { name: 'recession', budgetCut: 0.20, hiringFreeze: true }
  ]
})
