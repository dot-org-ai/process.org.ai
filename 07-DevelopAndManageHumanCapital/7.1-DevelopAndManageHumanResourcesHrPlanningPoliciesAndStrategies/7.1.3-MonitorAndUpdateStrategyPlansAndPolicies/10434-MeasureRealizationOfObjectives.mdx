# Measure realization of objectives

> Business-as-Code definition for measuring the realization of HR objectives. Models the tracking, scoring, and reporting of progress against established workforce goals and strategic HR targets.

## Overview

Determining the accomplishment of HR goals and objectives. Evaluate the effectiveness of the HR function by estimating the present rate of achievement of the established objectives. Use metrics to determine if the objectives are being realized. Leverage measures such as turnover, training, return on human capital, costs of labor, and expenses per employee.

const scorecard = await measurement.scoreObjectiveProgress({
  objectiveSet: 'FY2026-HR-Objectives',
  reportingPeriod: 'Q3-2026',
  includeHistoricalTrend: true,
  compareToBaseline: true
})

// Flag underperforming areas and propose corrective actions
const interventions = await measurement.proposeCorrectiveActions({
  underperformingObjectives: scorecard.belowTarget,
  impactThreshold: 'high',
  budgetConstraint: 50000
})
