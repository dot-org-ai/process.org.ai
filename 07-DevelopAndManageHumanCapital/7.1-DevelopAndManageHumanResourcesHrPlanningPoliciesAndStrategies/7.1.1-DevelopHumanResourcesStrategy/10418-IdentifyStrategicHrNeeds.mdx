# Identify strategic HR needs

> Business-as-Code definition for strategic human resources needs identification. Models the process of assessing current workforce capabilities, forecasting future talent demands, and aligning human capital priorities with business strategy.

## Overview

Strategically defining the current and future needs for developing an efficient HR strategy. Analyze the organization's workforce against its strategic plan to surface capability gaps, anticipate leadership pipeline shortfalls, and quantify talent demand across business units and geographies. The output drives downstream planning for roles, costs, and measures.
