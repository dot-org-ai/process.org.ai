# Develop strategy for HR systems/technologies/tools

> Business-as-Code definition for planning the selection, deployment, and management of HR technology platforms, tools, and systems that enable efficient human capital operations.

## Overview

Creating a strategy for the use of systems/technologies/tools in operating the HR function. Create a strategy concerning the use and utility of HR support tools and technologies. Decide what specific tools to use and in what quantity. Determine the levels of technology required for HR management, including HRIS, ATS, LMS, payroll, and analytics platforms. Build a multi-year technology roadmap aligned with the broader HR strategy.
