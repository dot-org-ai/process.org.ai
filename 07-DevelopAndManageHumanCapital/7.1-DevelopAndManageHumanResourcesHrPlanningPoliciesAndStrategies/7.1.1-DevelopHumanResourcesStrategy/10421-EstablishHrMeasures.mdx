> Business-as-Code definition for defining key performance indicators, scorecards, and measurement frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of human resources programs and operations.

## Overview

Evaluating the performance of the HR function. Lay out the course of HR procedures that would formulate a plan of action needed to fulfill strategic HR needs. Deploy measures such as hiring policies, leave management, internal code of conducts, and compensation structure. Design balanced scorecards linking HR outcomes to business results, and implement the data collection and reporting infrastructure to support ongoing measurement.
