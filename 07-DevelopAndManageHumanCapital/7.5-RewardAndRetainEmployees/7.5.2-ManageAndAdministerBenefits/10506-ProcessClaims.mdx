# Process claims

> Business-as-Code definition for benefits claims processing. Models the end-to-end lifecycle of employee benefit claims from intake through adjudication, reimbursement calculation, payment, and decision communication, ensuring compliance with plan terms and regulatory requirements.

## Overview

Processing formal requests from employees claiming entitlement to benefits under their enrolled plans. This includes receiving claims with supporting documentation, validating employee enrollment status and plan coverage, adjudicating claims against plan terms and benefit schedules, calculating reimbursement amounts accounting for deductibles, co-pays, and out-of-pocket maximums, processing payments to employees or healthcare providers, and communicating decisions with explanation of benefits (EOB) statements. The process handles medical, dental, vision, disability, and voluntary benefit claims while maintaining compliance with ERISA, HIPAA, and state insurance regulations.
