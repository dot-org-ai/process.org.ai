# Perform benefit reconciliation

> Business-as-Code definition for benefit reconciliation. Models the process of comparing internal enrollment records, payroll deductions, and carrier invoices to identify and resolve discrepancies in benefit plan billing, ensuring accurate premium payments and enrollment synchronization.

## Overview

Carrying out reconciliation of benefits delivered to employees by comparing internal HRIS enrollment records against carrier invoices, validating payroll deduction accuracy against premium amounts, identifying discrepancies such as ghost enrollees (employees on carrier invoice but not in HRIS), missing enrollees (employees in HRIS but not on carrier invoice), and premium calculation errors. The process resolves variances through adjustments to carrier records or payroll deductions, recovers overpayments, and produces audit-ready reconciliation reports for finance and compliance. Reconciliation is performed monthly for active plans and annually for plan year close-out.
