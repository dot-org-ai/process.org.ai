# Administer benefit enrollment

> Business-as-Code definition for benefit enrollment administration. Models the end-to-end enrollment lifecycle including open enrollment windows, qualifying life event processing, eligibility verification, dependent documentation, and carrier file transmission.

## Overview

Handling the employee enrollment for obtaining benefits. This covers configuring and activating annual open enrollment and special enrollment periods, notifying eligible employees of available plans, capturing and validating benefit elections across medical, dental, vision, retirement, and voluntary plans, verifying dependent eligibility through required documentation, handling qualifying life events (marriage, birth, adoption, loss of coverage), resolving enrollment exceptions and disputes, and transmitting finalized elections to insurance carriers and third-party administrators for activation.
