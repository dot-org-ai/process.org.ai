# Develop family support systems

> Business-as-Code definition for family support systems development. Models the design and implementation of organizational support structures for employees with family responsibilities, including parental leave, childcare assistance, family medical leave, adoption support, and eldercare resources, in compliance with FMLA and state family leave laws.

## Overview

Creating a support structure that aligns with local and federal laws for families. This includes designing paid and unpaid parental leave policies (maternity, paternity, adoption), establishing childcare assistance programs such as on-site daycare, backup care partnerships, and dependent care FSA administration, building eldercare referral networks, configuring FMLA and state family leave administration workflows, creating adoption and fertility treatment reimbursement programs, and developing bereavement and family emergency leave policies. The output is a comprehensive family support framework that enhances employee retention, reduces caregiver-related attrition, and ensures compliance with federal and state family leave regulations.
