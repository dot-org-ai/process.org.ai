# Review retention and motivation indicators

> Business-as-Code definition for retention and motivation indicator review. Models the periodic analysis of workforce retention metrics, engagement survey data, turnover patterns, and flight risk signals to identify retention threats and inform corrective action plans.

## Overview

Reassessing the indicators for retention and motivation of employees. This includes analyzing voluntary turnover rates by department, tenure band, and job family; reviewing engagement survey results and eNPS scores; monitoring flight risk signals such as vesting cliffs, promotion stagnation, and compensation below market; tracking exit interview themes and regrettable loss patterns; benchmarking retention metrics against industry norms; and producing actionable recommendations for HR leadership on where to invest in retention interventions. The process runs quarterly with ad-hoc analysis triggered by significant attrition events.
