# Deliver programs to support work/life balance for employees

> Business-as-Code definition for work/life balance program delivery. Models the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs that promote balance between professional responsibilities and personal well-being, including flexible work arrangements, wellness initiatives, dependent care support, and leave policies.

## Overview

Designing programs that promote proper balance between work (career and ambition) and lifestyle (health, leisure, family, and personal development). This includes establishing flexible work arrangements such as remote work, compressed schedules, and flextime; launching wellness programs covering physical fitness, mental health, and stress management; providing dependent care assistance including childcare subsidies and elder care referrals; managing leave-of-absence policies beyond statutory requirements; and offering on-the-job development opportunities like sabbaticals and learning stipends. The process measures program effectiveness through employee satisfaction surveys, utilization metrics, and retention impact analysis.
