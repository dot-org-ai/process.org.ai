# Review compensation plan

> Business-as-Code definition for compensation plan review. Models the periodic evaluation of existing compensation structures against market benchmarks, internal equity analysis, budget constraints, and retention data to determine whether adjustments are needed to maintain competitiveness and retain talent.

## Overview

Analyzing existing compensation plans and making changes necessary to continue to retain employees. This includes conducting market salary surveys and comparing pay ranges against benchmark data, performing internal pay equity audits across protected classes and job families, reviewing compa-ratio distributions to identify overpaid and underpaid populations, evaluating the effectiveness of variable pay programs against business performance targets, assessing geographic pay differential accuracy, and producing recommendations for salary structure adjustments, merit budget allocation changes, or targeted market corrections. The review runs annually aligned with the compensation planning cycle and ad-hoc when triggered by elevated retention risk or significant market movement.
