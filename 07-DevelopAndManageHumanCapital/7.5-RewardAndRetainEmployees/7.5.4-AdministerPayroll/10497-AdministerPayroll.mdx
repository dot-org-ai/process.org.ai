# Administer payroll

> Business-as-Code definition for payroll administration. Models the end-to-end payroll processing lifecycle including gross pay calculation, tax withholding, deduction processing, net pay disbursement, regulatory filing, and general ledger reconciliation across all pay cycles.

## Overview

Managing the sum of all financial records of salaries for an employee, including wages, bonuses, and deductions. This includes collecting time and attendance data, calculating gross pay from base salary, overtime, shift differentials, and variable pay components, computing federal, state, and local tax withholdings, applying pre-tax and post-tax deductions (benefits premiums, retirement contributions, garnishments), generating net pay for direct deposit or check issuance, producing itemized pay stubs, submitting quarterly and annual tax filings (941, W-2, state unemployment), and reconciling payroll journal entries against the general ledger. The process handles multi-state, multi-currency, and expatriate payroll scenarios with compliance across all applicable jurisdictions.
