# Develop salary/compensation structure and plan

> Business-as-Code definition for developing salary and compensation structure and plan. Models the process of designing the pay architecture including job grades, salary bands, variable pay, bonuses, and allowances that form the organization's total cash compensation framework.

## Overview

Creating the framework for the provision of salary/compensation to employees. Conduct market benchmarking studies to establish competitive pay positioning. Define job grades and salary bands with appropriate range spreads and midpoint progressions. Structure compensation into components including fixed pay, variable pay, bonuses, and allowances such as medical allowance and housing allowance. Design performance-based incentive schemes tied to individual and organizational goals. Model the financial impact of proposed compensation structures on total payroll budget. Obtain executive approval and publish the compensation plan for organizational implementation.
