# Reward and motivate employees

> Business-as-Code definition for employee reward and motivation. Models the design, delivery, and measurement of monetary and non-monetary recognition programs that drive employee engagement, reinforce desired behaviors, and improve retention.

## Overview

Rewarding and stimulating the performance efforts of employees through structured recognition programs. This includes designing peer-to-peer recognition platforms, administering milestone awards (tenure, achievement), delivering spot recognition for above-and-beyond contributions, managing non-monetary perks such as extra PTO or development stipends, and measuring program effectiveness through engagement surveys and participation analytics. The goal is to drive both extrinsic motivation through tangible rewards and intrinsic motivation through meaningful recognition and growth opportunities.
