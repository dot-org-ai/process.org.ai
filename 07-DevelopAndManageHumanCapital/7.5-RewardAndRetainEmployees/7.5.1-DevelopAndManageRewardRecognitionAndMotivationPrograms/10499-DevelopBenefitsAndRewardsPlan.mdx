# Develop benefits and rewards plan

> Business-as-Code definition for developing benefits and rewards plan. Models the process of designing the non-cash and indirect compensation offerings including health insurance, retirement plans, recognition programs, and perquisites that complement the salary structure to form total rewards.

## Overview

Developing a plan for provision of rewards, commission, and benefits to employees. Design health and welfare benefit packages including medical, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance. Structure retirement benefit plans such as defined contribution, pension, and deferred compensation programs. Create non-monetary reward programs including recognition awards, flexible work arrangements, professional development subsidies, and wellness programs. Evaluate benefit plan funding models and carrier partnerships. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (ERISA, ACA, COBRA) across all benefit offerings. Develop employee communication materials that clearly explain the total rewards value proposition.
