# Administer compensation and rewards to employees

> Business-as-Code definition for compensation and rewards administration. Models the ongoing execution of compensation plans including base salary disbursements, variable pay calculations, equity vest processing, and rewards distribution in compliance with approved compensation frameworks.

## Overview

Managing the provision of compensations and rewards to the employees while maintaining consistency with the compensation and benefits plan. This includes executing merit increases, processing bonus payouts, administering equity vesting schedules, applying geographic and role-based differentials, and ensuring all disbursements align with the approved compensation structure. The process also handles retroactive adjustments, off-cycle payments, and maintains audit trails for SOX and regulatory compliance.
