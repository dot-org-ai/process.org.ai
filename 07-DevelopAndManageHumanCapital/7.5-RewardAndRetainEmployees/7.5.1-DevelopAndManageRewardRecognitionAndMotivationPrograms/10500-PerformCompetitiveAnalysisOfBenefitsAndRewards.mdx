# Perform competitive analysis of benefits and rewards

> Business-as-Code definition for performing competitive analysis of benefits and rewards. Models the process of benchmarking the organization's total rewards offerings against peer companies and industry standards to identify competitive gaps, inform plan design, and support talent attraction and retention strategies.

## Overview

Analyzing and evaluating the organization's benefits and rewards plan. Benchmark the total rewards package against peer organizations, industry norms, and regional market data. Participate in and purchase compensation and benefits survey data from recognized providers. Compare specific benefit elements including health plan design, retirement contributions, paid time off, recognition programs, and perquisites. Identify areas where the organization leads, matches, or trails the competitive market. Quantify the cost of closing competitive gaps. Produce executive-ready benchmarking reports with recommendations for plan adjustments. Ensure benchmarking data adheres to antitrust safe harbor guidelines.
