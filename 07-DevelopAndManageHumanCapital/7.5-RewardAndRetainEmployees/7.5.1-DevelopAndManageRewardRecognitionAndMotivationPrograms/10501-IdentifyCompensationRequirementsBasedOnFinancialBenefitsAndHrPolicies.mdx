# Identify compensation requirements based on financial, benefits, and HR policies

> Business-as-Code definition for compensation requirements identification. Models the process of analyzing financial constraints, benefits obligations, and HR policy mandates to determine the compensation framework that governs pay structures across the organization.

## Overview

Recognizing the employee requirements for compensation on the basis of the financial, benefits, and HR policies of the organization. This includes reviewing budget allocations and labor cost targets, mapping benefits obligations such as statutory and voluntary programs, and aligning compensation structures with HR policies covering equity, pay transparency, and regulatory compliance. The output is a consolidated compensation requirements document that informs salary structure design, benefits planning, and total rewards strategy.
