# Manage separation

> Business-as-Code definition for employee separation management. Models the end-to-end process of managing voluntary resignations, involuntary terminations, and reduction-in-force layoffs, including exit interviews, final pay processing, benefits continuation (COBRA), asset recovery, system access revocation, and compliance documentation.

## Overview

Managing the process of employee separation, including resignations, discharges, and layoffs. This includes receiving and processing resignation notices or initiating termination documentation, conducting exit interviews to capture departure reasons, calculating and disbursing final pay including accrued PTO and severance, administering COBRA benefit continuation notices, recovering company assets (laptop, badge, keys), revoking system access and credentials, processing outplacement services for eligible separating employees, and maintaining separation records for compliance with WARN Act, OWBPA, and state-specific requirements. The process handles voluntary separations (resignation, mutual agreement) and involuntary separations (termination for cause, performance-based, reduction in force) with distinct workflows and compliance safeguards.
