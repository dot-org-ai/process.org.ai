# Manage leave of absence

> Business-as-Code definition for managing employee leave of absence. Models the complete process of administering paid and unpaid leave requests, ensuring policy compliance, tracking leave balances, and coordinating return-to-work transitions.

## Overview

Managing the period of time that an employee must be away from their primary job, while maintaining the status of employee (i.e., paid and unpaid leave of absence but not vacations, holidays, hiatuses, sabbaticals, and work-from-home programs). Administer FMLA, parental, medical, personal, and military leave types. Ensure regulatory compliance, coordinate coverage during absences, and facilitate smooth return-to-work processes.
