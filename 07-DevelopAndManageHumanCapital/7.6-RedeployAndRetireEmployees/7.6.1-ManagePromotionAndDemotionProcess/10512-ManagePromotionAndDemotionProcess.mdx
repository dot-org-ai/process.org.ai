# Manage promotion and demotion process

> Business-as-Code definition for promotion and demotion management. Models the end-to-end process of evaluating employees for role changes, conducting calibration reviews, executing promotions and demotions with compensation adjustments, and communicating outcomes to employees and stakeholders.

## Overview

Administering the process of promoting and demoting employees. This includes evaluating promotion eligibility against performance ratings, tenure, competency assessments, and readiness criteria; initiating formal promotion or demotion requests with business justification; conducting cross-functional calibration sessions to ensure consistency and fairness across departments; routing requests through multi-level approval workflows; adjusting salary bands, job grades, titles, and benefits upon approval; and communicating role changes to the employee, their team, and supporting departments. The process supports horizontal promotions (lateral moves with expanded scope), vertical promotions (grade advancement), and involuntary or voluntary demotions with appropriate documentation and compliance safeguards.
