# Manage retirement

> Business-as-Code definition for retirement management. Models the end-to-end process of planning, processing, and administering employee retirements including eligibility assessment, pension benefit calculations, benefits transition to retiree status, knowledge transfer facilitation, and compliance with ERISA pension regulations.

## Overview
