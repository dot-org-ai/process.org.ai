# Sell by-products

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for sell by-products (petroleum-downstream)

## Overview

Selling  by-products that have commercial value.  When oil and gas wells are depleted and the hydrocarbons are processed into a format that can be pipelined to the end user market, a number of by-products that have commercial value are yielded and sold.  For example, when raw natural gas is processed into sales gas for the end user, a number of by products are yielded.  These are natural-gas condensate, sulfur, ethane, natural-gas liquids (NGL): propane, butanes and C5+ (which is the commonly used term for pentanes plus higher molecular weight hydrocarbons).  Coal gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made from coal and supplied to the user via a piped distribution system.  In the process of converting coal into coke, a fuel with few impurities and high carbon content, the volatile matter in the coal is vaporized and driven off. This volatile matter is processed to recover by-product coal chemicals and to condition the gas so that it can be used as a fuel gas.
