# Define product technical documentation management requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for defining product technical documentation management requirements. Models documentation capability planning, sourcing decisions, and lifecycle support documentation governance.

## Overview

Defining sourcing and procurement requirements for new product technical documentation management. Make sourcing-based decisions that identify the capabilities that will be required in order to launch the new product. This documentation will be used to support the product following entry into service. It is compiled and managed in Manage product and process related data [12082], but the capability to manage and maintain this documentation must be defined and established.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyDocumentationTypes | Catalog the types of technical documentation required for the product lifecycle |
| defineManagementCapabilities | Specify the systems, tools, and workflows needed for documentation management |
| assessSourcingOptions | Evaluate internal versus external sourcing for documentation creation and maintenance |
| establishRetentionPolicies | Define retention periods, archival rules, and disposal procedures |
| approveDocumentationPlan | Formally authorize the technical documentation management plan |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineProductTechnicalDocumentationManagementRequirements } from '@headlessly/define-product-technical-documentation-management-requirements'

const docManager = defineProductTechnicalDocumentationManagementRequirements()

// Identify required documentation types for a new product
const docTypes = await docManager.identifyDocumentationTypes({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a',
  categories: ['userManual', 'serviceGuide', 'partsCatalog', 'regulatoryFiling']
})

// Assess sourcing options for documentation creation
const sourcing = await docManager.assessSourcingOptions({
  documentTypes: docTypes.map(d => d.id),
  evaluationCriteria: ['cost', 'quality', 'turnaroundTime']
})
```
