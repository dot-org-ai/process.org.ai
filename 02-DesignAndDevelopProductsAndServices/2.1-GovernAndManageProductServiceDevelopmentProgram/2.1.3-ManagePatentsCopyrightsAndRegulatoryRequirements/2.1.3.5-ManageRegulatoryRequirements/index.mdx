# Manage regulatory requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for managing regulatory requirements in product development. Models regulatory training, record-keeping, and submission lifecycle management.

## Overview

Aligning regulatory activities related to managing industry requirements. Train employees on regulatory requirements. Records for the appropriate regulatory agencies must be maintained and the new product process must be approved by the appropriate regulatory body before it is published to the organization. The submission lifecycle - i.e. creation, review, and approval of the submission and its components must be managed in a collaborative fashion.
