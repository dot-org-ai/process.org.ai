# Identify and refine performance indicators

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying and refining product performance indicators. Models KPI definition, measurement calibration, and metrics framework governance for evolving product portfolios.

## Overview

Attuning the performance measures of products/services to better reflect the revamped portfolio of solution offerings. Revise the parameters used to measure performance, apropos the organization's product/service offerings. (Modify these standards in consideration of the changes made to the portfolio by Introduce new products/services [10077] and Retire outdated products/services [10078].)

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyAndRefinePerformanceIndicators } from '@headlessly/identify-and-refine-performance-indicators'

const indicators = identifyAndRefinePerformanceIndicators()

// Audit existing indicators for the updated portfolio
const audit = await indicators.auditExistingIndicators({
  portfolioId: 'portfolio-2024',
  includeRetiredProducts: false
})

// Define new indicators for a recently launched product
const newKpis = await indicators.defineNewIndicators({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a',
  categories: ['revenue', 'adoption', 'quality', 'satisfaction'],
  targetPeriod: 'Q1-2025'
})
