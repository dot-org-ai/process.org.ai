# Conduct post launch review

> Business-as-Code definition for post-launch product review. Models the analytics, market performance analysis, supply chain assessment, quality review, and financial evaluation performed after a product reaches the market.

## Overview

Learning from either a test or a full production run within the consumer market. Companies use this as an opportunity to both test and react to new products, ideas, or innovations based on the initial reaction of consumers on an individual level. Within this process, analytics are used to determine the relative success of a new product offering. Within this process, companies will launch key analytics to test a products acceptance. They will also review market performance and compare to similar products and against the business case or the financial plan. Companies can also measure the effectiveness of their supply chain network, and can apply what is learned from the post launch review to other new products, processes, and procedures to ensure and enhance the product quality.
