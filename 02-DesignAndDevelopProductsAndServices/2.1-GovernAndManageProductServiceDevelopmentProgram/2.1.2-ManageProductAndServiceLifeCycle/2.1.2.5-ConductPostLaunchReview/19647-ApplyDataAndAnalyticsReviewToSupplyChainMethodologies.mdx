# Apply data and analytics review to supply chain methodologies

> Business-as-Code definition for applying data and analytics to supply chain methodology improvements. Models data-driven supply chain optimization, gap analysis, and efficiency enhancement.

## Overview

Collecting and examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information and correlate gaps and efficiencies to the existing supply chain channels. Apply the information to make better business decisions to the related supply chain methodologies to meet efficiency.

const scAnalytics = applyDataAndAnalyticsReviewToSupplyChainMethodologies()

// Analyze efficiency gaps in the supply chain
const gaps = await scAnalytics.analyzeEfficiencyGaps({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a',
  channels: ['directShip', 'warehouse', 'dropShip'],
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Model optimization scenarios
const scenarios = await scAnalytics.modelOptimizationScenarios({
  currentState: gaps.baseline,
  variables: ['leadTime', 'inventoryLevels', 'transportMode']
})
