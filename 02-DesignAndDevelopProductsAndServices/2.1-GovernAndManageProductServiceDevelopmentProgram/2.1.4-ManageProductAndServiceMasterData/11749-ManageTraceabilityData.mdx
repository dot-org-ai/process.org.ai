# Manage traceability data

> Business-as-Code definition for manage traceability data. Models managing product and service master data governance, storage, and access control.

## Overview

Identifying and handling data accessed by the permitted touch points. Ensure that no data is accessible to any unnecessary recipient. Data flow should be controlled through secured access and free from unauthorized access.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
manage:
  object: Traceability Data
  actor: MasterDataManager
  result: MasterDataRecord
```

import { manageTraceabilityData } from '@headlessly/manage-traceability-data'

const client = manageTraceabilityData()

// Create a new master data entry with validated attributes
const result = await client.createMasterRecord({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Modify existing master data records through controlled change process
const result2 = await client.updateMasterData({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
