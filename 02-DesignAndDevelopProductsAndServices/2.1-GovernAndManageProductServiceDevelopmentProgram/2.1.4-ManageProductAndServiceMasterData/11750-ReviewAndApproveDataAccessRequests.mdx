const client = reviewAndApproveDataAccessRequests()

// Create a new master data entry with validated attributes
const result = await client.createMasterRecord({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Modify existing master data records through controlled change process
const result2 = await client.updateMasterData({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
