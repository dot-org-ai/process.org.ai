# Plan and develop cost and quality targets

> Business-as-Code definition for planning and developing cost and quality targets for product development. Models budget allocation, quality standard setting, and target-based development governance.

## Overview

Setting prerequisites for the cost of development and quality standards for the new solutions' portfolio and/or its individual offerings. Set targets for the budget and quality standards for the revamped portfolio of solution offerings. Prepare a plan for the outlay required for revising and adding new product/services. Identify intended levels of quality for these, bearing in mind the existing standards of solutions offered by the organization and its competitors. Enlist senior management executives, particularly those responsible for finance and budgeting, product/service design, manufacturing/processing, delivery, and quality control.

## Related Processes

| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| 2.1.1.3 Prioritize and select new product/service concepts | Upstream - selected concepts need cost and quality targets |
| 2.1.1.5 Specify development timing targets | Parallel - timing targets coordinate with cost constraints |
| 2.3.1.2 Prepare high-level business case and technical assessment | Downstream - cost targets feed business case preparation |

## Usage

```typescript
import { planAndDevelopCostAndQualityTargets } from '@headlessly/plan-and-develop-cost-and-quality-targets'

const planner = planAndDevelopCostAndQualityTargets()

// Define cost targets for a product concept
const targets = await planner.defineCostTargets({
  conceptId: 'concept-a',
  developmentBudgetCeiling: 500000,
  unitCostTarget: 45.00,
  currency: 'USD'
})

// Set quality standards based on competitive benchmarks
const standards = await planner.setQualityStandards({
  conceptId: 'concept-a',
  benchmarkSource: 'industry-top-quartile',
  metrics: ['defectRate', 'durability', 'customerSatisfaction']
})
