# Plan for product/service offering modifications

> Business-as-Code definition for planning product and service offering modifications. Models change program design, stakeholder coordination, and systematic modification planning.

## Overview

Developing a programmatic procedure for changing products/services while paying heed to all stakeholders involved and the prerequisites identified. Create a plan for changing the existing portfolio of solution offerings. Develop a systematic program for the design, processing, and delivery of the new product/service concepts. Construct project-flow diagrams. Identify the stakeholders involved and personnel responsible for each stage, as well as the necessary decisions. Earmark the budgetary outlay, and conduct any strategic planning required.

  productId: 'prod-2024-a',
  modificationTypes: ['featureAddition', 'qualityImprovement'],
  targetLaunchDate: '2025-06-01'
})

// Map stakeholder roles for the modification
const stakeholders = await planner.mapStakeholderRoles({
  modificationId: scope.id,
  departments: ['Engineering', 'Marketing', 'Operations', 'QA']
})
