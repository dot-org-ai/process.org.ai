# Specify development timing targets

> Business-as-Code definition for specifying development timing targets. Models milestone scheduling, deadline assignment, and development timeline governance for product portfolios.

## Overview

Determining the individual and collective timeframe for realizing new/revised solutions. Create a schedule that clearly demarcates the timeframes designated for the development of every new solution and/or revising each of the existing ones. Create a timetable by setting deadlines for each step in overhauling the product/service portfolio.

```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| definePhaseDeadlines | Set target dates for each development phase per product concept |
| estimateDevelopmentDuration | Calculate expected duration based on scope, complexity, and resources |
| sequenceMilestones | Order key milestones across the portfolio development calendar |
| identifyCriticalPath | Determine the longest dependency chain that constrains delivery |
| allocateTimeBuffers | Add contingency buffers to high-risk development phases |
| publishDevelopmentSchedule | Release the finalized timeline to all stakeholders |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| phaseDeadlinesDefined | Target dates established for all development phases |
| durationEstimated | Development duration calculated for each concept |
| milestonesSequenced | Portfolio milestones ordered on the master calendar |
| criticalPathIdentified | Longest dependency chain documented |
| timeBuffersAllocated | Contingency time assigned to high-risk phases |
| schedulePublished | Finalized development schedule distributed to stakeholders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getDevelopmentTimeline | Retrieve the master development schedule for the portfolio |
| getMilestonesByProduct | List milestones and deadlines for a specific product concept |
| getCriticalPathItems | Access tasks and dependencies on the critical path |
| getScheduleVariance | Retrieve actual versus planned timing data |

## Usage

```typescript
import { specifyDevelopmentTimingTargets } from '@headlessly/specify-development-timing-targets'

const scheduler = specifyDevelopmentTimingTargets()

// Estimate development duration for a concept
const estimate = await scheduler.estimateDevelopmentDuration({
  conceptId: 'concept-a',
  complexity: 'high',
  teamSize: 12,
  phases: ['design', 'prototype', 'testing', 'launch']
})

// Define phase deadlines based on estimates
const deadlines = await scheduler.definePhaseDeadlines({
  conceptId: 'concept-a',
  startDate: '2025-01-15',
  phases: estimate.phases,
  bufferPercentage: 15
})
```
