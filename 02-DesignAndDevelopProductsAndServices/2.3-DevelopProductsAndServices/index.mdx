# Develop products and services

> Business-as-Code definition for product and service development. Models the design, prototyping, market testing, production preparation, manufacturing support, and launch validation processes for bringing new offerings to market.

## Overview

Developing new products/services from scratch, including all activities associated with the design, prototyping, evaluation, and market testing of these planned offerings.
