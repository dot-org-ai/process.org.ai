# Design and obtain necessary materials and equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for design and obtain necessary materials and equipment. Models preparing for production and marketplace introduction, including material procurement, process validation, and channel coordination.

## Overview

Developing and/or sourcing the essential machinery needed for creating purpose-built processes, as well as the raw materials, to produce the new products/services. Either design the equipment and materials needed internally, or source from external vendors. Obtain the feedstock or raw materials needed to prepare the finished products, as well as the machinery - hardware and software - needed to arrange production lines, factory operations, assemblies, and manufacturing processes. Revisit the technologies that underpin the new or revised products/services in order to source the right equipment and materials.
