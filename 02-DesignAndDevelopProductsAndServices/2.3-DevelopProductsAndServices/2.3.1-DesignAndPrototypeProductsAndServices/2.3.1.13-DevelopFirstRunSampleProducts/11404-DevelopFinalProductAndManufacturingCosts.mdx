# Develop final product and manufacturing costs

> Business-as-Code definition for develop final product and manufacturing costs. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Calculating comprehensive product unit costs including raw materials, labor, overhead, tooling amortization, and packaging to establish final cost-of-goods-sold projections. Gathering actual cost data from first-run production, supplier quotes, and process time studies. Comparing realized costs against original business case targets and identifying cost reduction opportunities before committing to full-scale production volumes.

const client = developFinalProductAndManufacturingCosts()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
