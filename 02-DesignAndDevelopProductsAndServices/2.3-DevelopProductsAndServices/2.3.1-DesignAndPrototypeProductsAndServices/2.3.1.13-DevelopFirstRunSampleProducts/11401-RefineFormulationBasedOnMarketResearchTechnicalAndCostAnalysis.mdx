# Refine formulation based on market research, technical and cost analysis

> Business-as-Code definition for refine formulation based on market research, technical and cost analysis. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Adjusting product formulation, composition, or configuration based on insights from market research, technical feasibility studies, and cost-benefit analyses to optimize market fit and manufacturability. Balancing customer-desired features with technical constraints and cost targets. Iterating on material selections, ingredient ratios, or component specifications to achieve the optimal balance of performance, quality, and cost efficiency for first-run production.
