# Develop first run/sample products

> Business-as-Code definition for develop first run/sample products. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Producing initial manufacturing runs or sample products to validate production processes, refine product formulations, and confirm cost projections before full-scale production. Integrating market research findings, technical feasibility assessments, and cost analysis to optimize the product formulation and manufacturing parameters. Developing final product costing models, revising financial projections based on actual production data, and making go/no-go decisions for full commercialization.

const client = developFirstRunsampleProducts()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
