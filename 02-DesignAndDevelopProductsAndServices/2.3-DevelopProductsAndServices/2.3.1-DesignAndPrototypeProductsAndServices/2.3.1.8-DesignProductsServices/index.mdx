## Usage

```typescript
import { designProductsservices } from '@headlessly/design-productsservices'

const client = designProductsservices()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
