# Eliminate quality and reliability problems

> Business-as-Code definition for eliminate quality and reliability problems. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Eliminating any problems relating to utility of the product/service over the course of its expected lifetime. Tweak the prototype in order to comply with the required quality and reliability standards. Further refine the prototype, so it may be subjected to testing.

const client = eliminateQualityAndReliabilityProblems()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
