# Collaborate design with suppliers and contract manufacturers

> Business-as-Code definition for collaborate design with suppliers and contract manufacturers. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Engaging suppliers and contract manufacturers early in the prototyping process to validate material availability, component feasibility, and manufacturing constraints. Sharing design specifications, tolerances, and quality requirements with external partners to ensure alignment between design intent and production capabilities. Conducting joint design reviews, negotiating tooling and material costs, and iterating on component specifications to optimize for both performance and manufacturability.

const client = collaborateDesignWithSuppliersAndContractManufacturers()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
