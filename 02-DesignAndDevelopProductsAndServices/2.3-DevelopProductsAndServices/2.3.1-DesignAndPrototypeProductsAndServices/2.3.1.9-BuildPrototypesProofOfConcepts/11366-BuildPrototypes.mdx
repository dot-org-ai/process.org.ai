# Build prototypes

> Business-as-Code definition for build prototypes. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Constructing functional prototypes using rapid prototyping methods, 3D printing, CNC machining, or traditional fabrication techniques to create tangible representations of product designs. Translating design specifications into physical or digital prototypes that can be evaluated for form, fit, and function. Building prototypes at various fidelity levels from concept models to production-representative samples to support iterative design validation and stakeholder review.

## Usage

```typescript
import { buildPrototypes } from '@headlessly/build-prototypes'

const client = buildPrototypes()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
