# Revise business case and make go/no go decision

> Business-as-Code definition for revise business case and make go/no go decision. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Updating the business case with prototype cost data, test results, and revised market assumptions to support a formal go/no-go investment decision. Comparing actual prototype performance and cost metrics against original business case projections. Presenting updated financial models, risk assessments, and competitive analyses to the product steering committee for a stage-gate decision on whether to proceed with full production, iterate further, or terminate the project.
