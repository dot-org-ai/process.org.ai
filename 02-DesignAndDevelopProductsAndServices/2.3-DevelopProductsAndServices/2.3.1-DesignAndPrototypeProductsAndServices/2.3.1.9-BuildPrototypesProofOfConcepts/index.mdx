# Build prototypes/proof of concepts

> Business-as-Code definition for build prototypes/proof of concepts. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Building prototypes for shortlisted product/service concepts. Develop prototypes for those product/service concepts that have been identified for further development. Provide proof-of-concepts, and test any processes involved. Build prototypes in line with the design specifications already outlined. Enlist the solutioning and/or design staff.

  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
