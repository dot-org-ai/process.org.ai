# Develop and test prototype production and/or service delivery process

> Business-as-Code definition for develop and test prototype production and/or service delivery process. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Creating the new manufacturing/delivery processes for the new products/services, and testing them to ensure proper functioning. Create the production/delivery process for the prototypes that have been built for the new products/services. Conduct trial-runs to test these processes and their integration with the organization's other processes.

const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
