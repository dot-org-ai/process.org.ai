# Assign resources to product/service project

> Business-as-Code definition for assign resources to product/service project. Models designing and prototyping products and services, from business case preparation through prototype testing and supplier collaboration.

## Overview

Allocating resources to the design, development, and evaluation of product/service concepts. Allocate funds, personnel, and time for developing the new and/or revised products/services. Begin to design the potential new product/service concepts that have been prioritized and selected for further development.

## Usage

```typescript
import { assignResourcesToProductserviceProject } from '@headlessly/assign-resources-to-productservice-project'

const client = assignResourcesToProductserviceProject()

// Create initial design concepts based on requirements specifications
const result = await client.developDesignConcept({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Construct physical or digital prototypes for testing and validation
const result2 = await client.buildPrototype({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
