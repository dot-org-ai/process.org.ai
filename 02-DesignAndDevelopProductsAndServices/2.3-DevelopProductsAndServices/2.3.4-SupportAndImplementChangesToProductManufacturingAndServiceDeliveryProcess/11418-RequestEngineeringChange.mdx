# Request engineering change

> Business-as-Code definition for request engineering change. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Requesting changes in the production and/or delivery operations for processing the new or revised products/services. Rectify any problems identified in the manufacturing or delivery processes (through Monitor production runs [11417]). Seek changes in components, repair machinery, optimize production lines, and tweak factory assemblies through a formal notice to the concerned division, known as an engineering change order.

## Usage

```typescript
import { requestEngineeringChange } from '@headlessly/request-engineering-change'

const client = requestEngineeringChange()

// Track manufacturing output quality, efficiency, and yield rates
const result = await client.monitorProductionPerformance({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Submit engineering change requests based on production findings
const result2 = await client.initiateEngineeringChange({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
