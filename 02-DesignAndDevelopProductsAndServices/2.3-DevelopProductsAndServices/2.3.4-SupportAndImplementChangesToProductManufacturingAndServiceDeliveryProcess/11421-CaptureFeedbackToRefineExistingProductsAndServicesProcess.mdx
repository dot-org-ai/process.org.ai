# Capture feedback to refine existing products and services process

> Business-as-Code definition for capture feedback to refine existing products and services process. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Collecting and synthesizing feedback from production operators, service delivery teams, customers, and quality inspectors to identify refinement opportunities for existing products and processes. Establishing structured feedback channels such as production floor suggestion systems, post-delivery surveys, and cross-functional review sessions. Analyzing feedback trends to prioritize improvement actions and routing actionable insights to product engineering, manufacturing, and quality assurance teams for resolution.

const client = captureFeedbackToRefineExistingProductsAndServicesProcess()

// Track manufacturing output quality, efficiency, and yield rates
const result = await client.monitorProductionPerformance({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Submit engineering change requests based on production findings
const result2 = await client.initiateEngineeringChange({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
