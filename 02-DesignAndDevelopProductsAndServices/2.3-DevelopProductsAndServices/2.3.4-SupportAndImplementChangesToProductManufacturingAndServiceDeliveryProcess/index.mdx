# Support and implement changes to product manufacturing and service delivery process

> Business-as-Code definition for support and implement changes to product manufacturing and service delivery process. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Managing the ongoing lifecycle of product manufacturing and service delivery processes after initial production launch. Monitoring production runs for quality, efficiency, and throughput. Initiating, evaluating, and implementing engineering change requests to address defects, improve yields, or incorporate design updates. Capturing feedback from production floor teams and service delivery personnel to drive continuous improvement. Defining and tracking key performance indicators for manufacturing and service delivery effectiveness.
