# Monitor production runs

> Business-as-Code definition for monitor production runs. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Regularly monitoring production runs of the production and/or delivery operations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { monitorProductionRuns } from '@headlessly/monitor-production-runs'

const client = monitorProductionRuns()

// Track manufacturing output quality, efficiency, and yield rates
const result = await client.monitorProductionPerformance({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Submit engineering change requests based on production findings
const result2 = await client.initiateEngineeringChange({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
