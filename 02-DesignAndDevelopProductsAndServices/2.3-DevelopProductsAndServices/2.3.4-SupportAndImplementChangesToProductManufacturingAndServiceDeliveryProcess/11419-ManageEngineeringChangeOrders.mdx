# Manage engineering change orders

> Business-as-Code definition for manage engineering change orders. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Coordinating the implementation of requests for component changes, equipment repairs, and the optimization of production/delivery processes. Oversee Request an engineering change [11418] in the production and/or delivery operations. Coordinate with the concerned divisions that will implement these changes.

```typescript
import { manageEngineeringChangeOrders } from '@headlessly/manage-engineering-change-orders'

const client = manageEngineeringChangeOrders()

// Track manufacturing output quality, efficiency, and yield rates
const result = await client.monitorProductionPerformance({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Submit engineering change requests based on production findings
const result2 = await client.initiateEngineeringChange({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
