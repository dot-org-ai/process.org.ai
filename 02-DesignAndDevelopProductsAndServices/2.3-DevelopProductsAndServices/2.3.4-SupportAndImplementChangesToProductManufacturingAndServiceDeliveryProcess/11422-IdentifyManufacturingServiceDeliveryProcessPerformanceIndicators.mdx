# Identify manufacturing/service delivery process performance indicators

> Business-as-Code definition for identify manufacturing/service delivery process performance indicators. Models supporting and implementing changes to product manufacturing and service delivery processes through engineering change management.

## Overview

Defining, selecting, and calibrating key performance indicators that measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of manufacturing and service delivery processes. Aligning performance metrics with organizational objectives, industry benchmarks, and customer expectations. Establishing measurement methodologies, data collection procedures, reporting cadences, and threshold targets to enable continuous monitoring and data-driven process improvement decisions.
