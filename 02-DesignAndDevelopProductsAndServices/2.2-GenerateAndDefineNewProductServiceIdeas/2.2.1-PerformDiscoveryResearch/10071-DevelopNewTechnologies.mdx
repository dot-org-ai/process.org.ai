# Develop new technologies

> Business-as-Code definition for develop new technologies. Models performing discovery research to identify emerging technologies and innovation opportunities.

## Overview

Developing new technologies from scratch to integrate into a revised portfolio of solutions. Develop new technological processes, models, and/or implements in-house, with the objective of improving existing solutions or creating new ones. Consider market realities, as well as the portfolio of products/services. Assess the results in conjunction with senior executives and personnel responsible for the design, processing, and delivery of these solutions. Engage the R&D function, and consider external sources such as offshore providers, specialized research agencies, and crowdsourcing communities.
