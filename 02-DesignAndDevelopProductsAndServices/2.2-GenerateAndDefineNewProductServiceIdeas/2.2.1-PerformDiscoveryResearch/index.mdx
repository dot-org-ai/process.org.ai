# Perform discovery research

> Business-as-Code definition for perform discovery research. Models performing discovery research to identify emerging technologies and innovation opportunities.

## Overview

Coordinating R&D activity to identify new technologies to integrate into the revamped portfolio of products/services. Conduct early-stage R&D activity to close gaps between existing solution offerings and changing market expectations. Triangulate appropriate technologies that can support the development of a revised product/service portfolio.
