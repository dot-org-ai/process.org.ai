# Identify new technologies

> Business-as-Code definition for identify new technologies. Models performing discovery research to identify emerging technologies and innovation opportunities.

## Overview

Determining new technologies to revise the portfolio of solution offerings. Identify recently developed technological advances that can be leveraged in the development or advancement of the organization's product/service portfolio. Enlist senior management in conjunction with personnel responsible for the design, processing, and delivery of products/services. Have the organization's research division(s) carry out the process.
