# Assess feasibility of integrating new leading technologies into product/service concepts

> Business-as-Code definition for assess feasibility of integrating new leading technologies into product/service concepts. Models performing discovery research to identify emerging technologies and innovation opportunities.

## Overview

Appraising the feasibility of integrating new technologies, whether developed as a custom solution or adopted from an external source, into revised portfolio of solution offerings. Examine recently developed technological advances for suitability to incorporate them into the concept of revised and/or new solution offerings. Enlist senior management, in consultation with in-house personnel responsible for the design, processing, and delivery of these solutions, as well as key supply-chain stakeholders.
