# Define product/service development requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for define product/service development requirements. Models defining product and service development requirements including functional, safety, regulatory, and user experience specifications.

## Overview

Encompassing the identification and capture of new product/service requirements or potential improvements to current products/services. Collaborating with members of the supply chain to ensure the feasibility of what is being defined in the requirements. For example, a product with manufacturing requirements that supply chain cannot currently fulfill requires a corporate decision to either upgrade manufacturing capabilities or abandon the new product. Enterprise-level effects and needs must be considered. Depending on the nature of the final product or service, these requirements are often defined as a set of abilities, such as availability or reliability, that influence product development decisions.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| elicitRequirements | Gather requirements from stakeholders, standards, and regulatory sources |
| categorizeRequirements | Organize requirements by type: functional, safety, regulatory, UX |
| validateRequirements | Confirm requirements are complete, consistent, and achievable |
| prioritizeRequirements | Rank requirements by business value and implementation complexity |
| approveRequirementsBaseline | Formally authorize the requirements specification for development |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| requirementsElicited | Requirements gathered from all sources |
| requirementsCategorized | Requirements organized by type and domain |
| requirementsValidated | Requirements completeness and consistency confirmed |
| requirementsPrioritized | Requirements ranked by value and complexity |
| requirementsBaselineApproved | Requirements specification authorized for development |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getRequirements | Retrieve requirements by product, type, or priority |
| getRequirementTraceability | Access requirement-to-source and requirement-to-test mappings |
| getRequirementStatus | Retrieve requirements implementation and validation status |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineProductserviceDevelopmentRequirements } from '@headlessly/define-productservice-development-requirements'

const client = defineProductserviceDevelopmentRequirements()

// Gather requirements from stakeholders, standards, and regulatory sources
const result = await client.elicitRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Organize requirements by type: functional, safety, regulatory, UX
const result2 = await client.categorizeRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
