## Usage

```typescript
import { defineProductserviceRequirements } from '@headlessly/define-productservice-requirements'

const client = defineProductserviceRequirements()

// Gather requirements from stakeholders, standards, and regulatory sources
const result = await client.elicitRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Organize requirements by type: functional, safety, regulatory, UX
const result2 = await client.categorizeRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
