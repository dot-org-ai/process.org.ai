# Derive security requirements for products and services

> Business-as-Code definition for derive security requirements for products and services. Models defining product and service development requirements including functional, safety, regulatory, and user experience specifications.

## Overview

Implementing security requirements through authentication and encryption of CE device data stream.  Utilize security measures such as cryptographic protocols and hardware security (smart cards).

## GraphDL

```yaml
derive:
  object: Security Requirements For Products And Services
  actor: RequirementsManager
  result: RequirementsSpecification
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| elicitRequirements | Gather requirements from stakeholders, standards, and regulatory sources |
| categorizeRequirements | Organize requirements by type: functional, safety, regulatory, UX |
| validateRequirements | Confirm requirements are complete, consistent, and achievable |
| prioritizeRequirements | Rank requirements by business value and implementation complexity |
| approveRequirementsBaseline | Formally authorize the requirements specification for development |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| requirementsElicited | Requirements gathered from all sources |
| requirementsCategorized | Requirements organized by type and domain |
| requirementsValidated | Requirements completeness and consistency confirmed |
| requirementsPrioritized | Requirements ranked by value and complexity |
| requirementsBaselineApproved | Requirements specification authorized for development |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getRequirements | Retrieve requirements by product, type, or priority |
| getRequirementTraceability | Access requirement-to-source and requirement-to-test mappings |
| getRequirementStatus | Retrieve requirements implementation and validation status |

## Usage

```typescript
import { deriveSecurityRequirementsForProductsAndServices } from '@headlessly/derive-security-requirements-for-products-and-services'

const client = deriveSecurityRequirementsForProductsAndServices()

// Gather requirements from stakeholders, standards, and regulatory sources
const result = await client.elicitRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})

// Organize requirements by type: functional, safety, regulatory, UX
const result2 = await client.categorizeRequirements({
  productId: 'prod-2025-a'
})
```
