# Classify products

> Business-as-Code definition for trade product classification. Models the assignment of harmonized tariff codes, export control classification numbers, and trade commodity codes to products for customs and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

Systematically categorizing products/services for their suitability to international trade. Create classes and categories for demarcating the types of products suitable for international trade. Study requisite national and international standards and the adherence of the organization's portfolio of offerings to these.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| gatherProductSpecifications | Collect technical data sheets, material composition, and functional descriptions for each product |
| assignHarmonizedTariffCode | Determine the correct Harmonized System (HS) or HTS code based on product characteristics |
| determineExportClassification | Map the product to export control classification numbers (ECCN) or Commerce Control List categories |
| validateClassificationRuling | Cross-reference the assigned codes against binding rulings and prior customs decisions |
| maintainClassificationDatabase | Update and manage the master product classification repository as products or regulations change |

## Events

|-------|-------------|
| productSpecificationsGathered | Technical data for the product has been collected for classification |
| harmonizedTariffCodeAssigned | HS or HTS tariff code assigned to the product |
| exportClassificationDetermined | ECCN or export control category assigned to the product |
| classificationRulingValidated | Classification confirmed against binding rulings or prior determinations |
| classificationDatabaseUpdated | Master classification repository updated with new or revised codes |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
