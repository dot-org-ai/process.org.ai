# Calculate duty

> Business-as-Code definition for customs duty calculation. Models the computation of applicable customs duties, tariffs, and excise taxes based on product classification, country of origin, and trade agreements.

## Overview

Computing the customs duties, tariffs, and excise taxes payable on imported goods based on product classification, country of origin, customs value, and applicable trade agreements. This process retrieves the correct tariff rate from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, applies preferential rates when free trade agreement eligibility is confirmed, and validates the final duty calculation against customs authority schedules. Accurate duty computation prevents penalties from underpayments and ensures the organization captures available duty savings.
