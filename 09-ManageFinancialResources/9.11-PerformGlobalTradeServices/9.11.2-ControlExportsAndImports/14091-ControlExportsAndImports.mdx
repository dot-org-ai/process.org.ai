# Control exports and imports

> Business-as-Code definition for export and import controls. Models the oversight of trade flows including export license requirements, import restrictions, and end-use verification for controlled goods and technologies.

## Overview

Overseeing and directing the flow of controlled goods and technologies to and from the organization to ensure compliance with export control regulations such as the EAR and ITAR. This process involves classifying items by their Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), assessing whether government licenses or permits are required, and verifying the legitimacy of end-users and end-use statements. Effective export and import controls protect the organization from sanctions violations, penalties, and reputational risk.
