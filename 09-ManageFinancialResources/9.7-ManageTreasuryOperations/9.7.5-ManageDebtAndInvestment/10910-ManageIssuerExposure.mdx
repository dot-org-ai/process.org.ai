# Manage issuer exposure

> Business-as-Code definition for issuer exposure management. Models the monitoring and control of credit concentration risk across investment counterparties, debt issuers, and financial institutions to prevent excessive single-name or sector exposure.

## Overview

Issuer exposure management involves monitoring and controlling credit concentration risk across investment counterparties, debt issuers, and financial institutions to prevent excessive single-name or sector exposure. Treasury teams compute real-time exposure across all instruments, track positions against policy-defined concentration limits, and assess the creditworthiness of each counterparty. When limit breaches occur, the process triggers escalation workflows that require immediate remediation through position reduction or limit exception approval from senior management.
