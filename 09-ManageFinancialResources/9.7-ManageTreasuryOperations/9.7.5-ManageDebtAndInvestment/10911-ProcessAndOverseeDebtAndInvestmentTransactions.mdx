# Process and oversee debt and investment transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for debt and investment transaction processing. Models the execution, settlement, and oversight of borrowing drawdowns, bond purchases, money market placements, and other treasury investment and debt transactions.

## Overview

Processing and overseeing debt and investment transactions encompasses the full trade lifecycle from order execution through settlement, confirmation, and reconciliation. This includes borrowing drawdowns, bond purchases and sales, money market placements, and other treasury investment activities. Each transaction requires counterparty confirmation of trade terms, timely settlement on value date, and post-settlement reconciliation against custodian records. Continuous portfolio position monitoring ensures treasury maintains accurate visibility into holdings, maturities, and yield performance.
