# Manage liquidity

> Business-as-Code definition for liquidity management. Models the monitoring and optimization of organizational liquidity through cash positioning, credit facility management, and contingency planning to ensure the ability to meet all financial obligations.

## Overview

Liquidity management ensures the organization maintains sufficient cash and cash-equivalent reserves to meet all financial obligations as they come due, including operating expenditures, debt maturities, and contingent commitments. This process involves continuous monitoring of liquidity ratios, managing revolving credit facility utilization, and conducting stress tests under adverse market conditions. Effective liquidity management balances the cost of holding excess reserves against the risk of being unable to fund critical operations, while maintaining compliance with regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio.
