# Produce debt and investment accounting transaction reports

> Business-as-Code definition for debt and investment accounting and reporting. Models the generation of accounting entries, portfolio valuations, and management reports for all debt and investment transactions including amortization schedules and fair value adjustments.

## Overview

Producing debt and investment accounting transaction reports involves generating the journal entries, portfolio valuations, and management reports required for all debt and investment activities. This encompasses computing premium and discount amortization for debt instruments, performing fair value mark-to-market adjustments for the investment portfolio, and recording unrealized gains and losses. Reports are compiled on scheduled frequencies and reconciled against the general ledger to ensure accuracy, supporting both internal management decision-making and external financial statement disclosures.
