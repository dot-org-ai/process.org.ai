# Manage financial intermediary relationships

> Business-as-Code definition for financial intermediary relationship management. Models the selection, onboarding, performance monitoring, and governance of investment banks, broker-dealers, custodians, and other financial service providers.

## Overview

Managing financial intermediary relationships encompasses the selection, onboarding, performance monitoring, and governance of investment banks, broker-dealers, custodians, and other financial service providers. Treasury teams evaluate intermediaries based on execution quality, research capabilities, pricing competitiveness, and operational reliability. Regular performance reviews and panel rotation ensure the organization maintains access to best-in-class financial services while managing counterparty concentration risk.
