# Process and oversee interest rate transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for interest rate transaction processing. Models the execution, valuation, and oversight of interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and other derivative instruments used to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

## Overview

Processing and overseeing interest rate transactions covers the full lifecycle of interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and other derivative instruments used to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations. This includes executing swap agreements with counterparties, confirming notional amounts and fixed/floating rate terms, processing periodic coupon payment settlements, and marking derivative positions to market. Treasury monitors swap maturities to plan rollovers or unwinds, ensuring the interest rate derivative portfolio remains aligned with the organization's risk management strategy and debt structure.
