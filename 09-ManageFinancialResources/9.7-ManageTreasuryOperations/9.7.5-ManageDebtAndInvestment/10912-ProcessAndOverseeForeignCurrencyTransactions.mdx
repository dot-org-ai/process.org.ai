# Process and oversee foreign currency transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign currency transaction processing. Models the execution, settlement, and monitoring of spot, forward, and swap foreign exchange transactions to support international operations and manage currency risk.

## Overview

Processing foreign currency transactions covers the execution, settlement, and monitoring of spot, forward, and swap foreign exchange transactions that support international operations and currency risk management. FX dealers execute trades through approved counterparties, confirm exchange rates and value dates, and ensure timely settlement of currency deliveries. Ongoing position monitoring tracks open FX exposures against policy limits and records mark-to-market valuations, while regular reporting captures transaction volumes, realized gains and losses, and execution quality metrics.
