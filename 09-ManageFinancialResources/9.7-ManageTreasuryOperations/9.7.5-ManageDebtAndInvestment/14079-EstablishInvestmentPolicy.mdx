# Establish investment policy

> Business-as-Code definition for investment policy establishment. Models the development, approval, and publication of corporate investment guidelines governing permissible instruments, credit quality requirements, concentration limits, and return objectives.

## Overview

Establishing investment policy involves developing, approving, and publishing the corporate investment guidelines that govern how the organization deploys surplus cash and manages its investment portfolio. The policy defines permissible instrument types, minimum credit quality requirements, concentration limits by issuer and sector, maximum maturity constraints, and return objectives prioritized by safety, liquidity, and yield. The investment policy statement is formally approved by the board or investment committee and reviewed periodically to reflect changes in market conditions, regulatory requirements, and organizational risk appetite.
