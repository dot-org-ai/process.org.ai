# Process and oversee electronic fund transfers (EFTs)

> Business-as-Code definition for electronic fund transfer processing and oversight. Models the initiation, authorization, execution, and monitoring of wire transfers, ACH payments, SWIFT messages, and other electronic payment methods.

## Overview

Initiating, authorizing, executing, and monitoring electronic fund transfers including wire transfers, ACH payments, SWIFT messages, and real-time payment networks. The process enforces dual-control authorization to prevent unauthorized disbursements, tracks transfer status through to beneficiary confirmation, and investigates failed or rejected transactions. Effective EFT oversight is critical for maintaining payment security, regulatory compliance, and timely settlement of financial obligations.
