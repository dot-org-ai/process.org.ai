# Develop cash flow forecasts

> Business-as-Code definition for cash flow forecast development. Models the construction of short-term and long-term cash flow projections using historical patterns, scheduled transactions, and business unit inputs to optimize liquidity planning.

## Overview

Constructing short-term and long-term cash flow projections by gathering inputs from accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, and business units. Forecast models combine historical patterns with scheduled transactions and macroeconomic assumptions to project daily, weekly, and monthly cash positions. Scenario analysis and regular forecast-to-actual variance reviews improve model accuracy over time, enabling treasury to make informed decisions about borrowing, investing, and liquidity reserves.

const forecasting = developCashFlowForecasts()

// Build a rolling 13-week cash flow forecast
const forecast = await forecasting.buildForecastModel({
  horizon: '13-week',
  entities: ['US-Corp', 'EU-GmbH'],
  granularity: 'weekly',
  includeScenarios: true
})

// Run scenario analysis under different business conditions
const scenarios = await forecasting.runForecastScenarios({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  scenarios: [
    { name: 'base', revenueGrowth: 0.05, collectionDays: 45 },
    { name: 'downturn', revenueGrowth: -0.10, collectionDays: 60 },
    { name: 'expansion', revenueGrowth: 0.15, collectionDays: 38 }
  ]
})

// Validate accuracy against prior period actuals
const accuracy = await forecasting.validateForecastAccuracy({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  comparisonPeriod: 'last-quarter',
  tolerancePercent: 5
})
