# Manage cash flows

> Business-as-Code definition for cash flow management. Models the active optimization of cash inflows and outflows through payment timing, collection acceleration, disbursement scheduling, and intercompany cash pooling.

## Overview

Actively optimizing the timing and volume of cash inflows and outflows through collection acceleration, disbursement scheduling, and intercompany cash pooling. The process strategically delays outbound payments to maximize float while accelerating customer receipts through early-payment incentives, automated reminders, and dunning escalation. Cash pooling arrangements across subsidiaries concentrate idle balances for investment or debt reduction, minimizing the organization's overall borrowing costs and improving working capital efficiency.

## Usage

```typescript

const cashFlow = manageCashFlows()

// Optimize disbursement timing for float maximization
const schedule = await cashFlow.scheduleDisbursements({
  period: '2026-Q1',
  optimizeFor: 'float-maximization',
  respectDiscountTerms: true,
  paymentMethods: ['ACH', 'wire', 'virtual-card']
})

// Accelerate collections for overdue receivables
const collections = await cashFlow.accelerateCollections({
  agingBucket: '30-60-days',
  strategies: ['early-payment-discount', 'auto-reminder', 'dunning-escalation'],
  targetReduction: 5
