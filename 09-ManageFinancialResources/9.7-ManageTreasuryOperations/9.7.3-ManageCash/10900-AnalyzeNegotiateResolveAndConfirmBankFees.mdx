# Analyze, negotiate, resolve, and confirm bank fees

> Business-as-Code definition for bank fee analysis and negotiation. Models the benchmarking, negotiation, dispute resolution, and confirmation of banking service charges, account analysis statements, and fee schedules.

## Overview

Reviewing bank account analysis statements for accuracy, benchmarking service charges against industry data, and negotiating fee reductions with banking partners. The process includes resolving billing disputes for incorrect or unexpected charges and confirming agreed-upon fee schedules in formal documentation. Systematic fee management ensures the organization pays competitive rates for banking services including wire transfers, ACH origination, account maintenance, and lockbox processing.
