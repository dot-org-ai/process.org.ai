# Manage and reconcile cash positions

> Business-as-Code definition for cash position management and reconciliation. Models the daily monitoring, reconciliation, and optimization of cash balances across all bank accounts, currencies, and legal entities.

## Overview

Monitoring, reconciling, and optimizing cash balances across all bank accounts, currencies, and legal entities on a daily basis. The process involves aggregating cash positions from multiple banking partners, matching internal records against bank statements to identify and resolve discrepancies, and concentrating idle funds into yield-bearing accounts. Accurate cash position management ensures the organization maintains sufficient liquidity while minimizing unproductive balances.
