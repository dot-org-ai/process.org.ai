# Manage and oversee banking relationships

> Business-as-Code definition for banking relationship management. Models the selection, onboarding, performance evaluation, and governance of commercial banking partners including account structures, service agreements, and relationship reviews.

## Overview

Selecting, onboarding, evaluating, and governing commercial banking partners to ensure the organization receives competitive services, pricing, and support. The process includes conducting RFP processes for new banking mandates, establishing account structures and connectivity, and performing periodic service quality reviews. Banking relationship rationalization reduces complexity and costs while ensuring adequate geographic coverage and credit diversification across the bank partner portfolio.
