# Evaluate and refine hedging positions

> Business-as-Code definition for refine hedging positions. Models the end-to-end process of evaluate and refine hedging positions as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Evaluating and refining hedging positions involves ongoing assessment of existing derivative hedges to determine whether they remain aligned with the underlying physical exposures and current market conditions. This includes comparing current hedge coverage ratios against targets, testing hedge effectiveness using dollar-offset or regression methods, analyzing basis risk between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, and recommending adjustments such as rolling forward maturing contracts, resizing positions to match changed exposures, or switching to more cost-effective instruments. The refinement process ensures the hedge portfolio remains optimally positioned to mitigate risk while minimizing unnecessary hedging costs.
