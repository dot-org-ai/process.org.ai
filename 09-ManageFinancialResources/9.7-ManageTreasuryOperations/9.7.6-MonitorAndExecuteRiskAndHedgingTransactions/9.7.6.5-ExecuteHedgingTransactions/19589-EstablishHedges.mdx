# Establish hedges

> Business-as-Code definition for hedges. Models the end-to-end process of establish hedges as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Establishing hedges involves selecting and executing derivative trades that offset the physical position exposures measured in the prior step. This includes determining the optimal hedge instruments (futures, forwards, swaps, or options), calculating the hedge ratio and notional amounts required to achieve the target coverage, obtaining trade execution approval, and placing orders with approved counterparties or exchanges. Each new hedge is formally designated under hedge accounting standards, with documentation linking the hedging instrument to the specific hedged item and defining the effectiveness assessment methodology.
