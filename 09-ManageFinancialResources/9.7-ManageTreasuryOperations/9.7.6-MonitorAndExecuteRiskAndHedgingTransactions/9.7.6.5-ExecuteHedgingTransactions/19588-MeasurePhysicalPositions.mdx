# Measure physical positions

> Business-as-Code definition for physical positions. Models the end-to-end process of measure physical positions as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Measuring physical positions involves quantifying the organization's underlying exposures in commodities, currencies, or other physical assets that need to be hedged using derivative instruments. This includes aggregating inventory volumes, committed purchase and sale contracts, forecasted production or consumption, and any other physical commitments that create market price risk. Accurate measurement of physical positions is the essential first step in the hedging process, providing the baseline against which derivative hedges are sized and the reference for ongoing hedge effectiveness evaluation.
