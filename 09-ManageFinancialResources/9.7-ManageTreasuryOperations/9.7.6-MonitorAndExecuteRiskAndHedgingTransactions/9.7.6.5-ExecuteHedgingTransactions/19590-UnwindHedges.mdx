# Unwind hedges

> Business-as-Code definition for hedges. Models the end-to-end process of unwind hedges as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Unwinding hedges involves closing out or terminating existing derivative positions when the underlying physical exposure has been reduced, the hedge is no longer effective, or market conditions warrant early termination. This includes determining which hedges to unwind based on changes in the physical position or hedging strategy, calculating the mark-to-market settlement value, negotiating early termination with counterparties, and processing the cash settlement. Hedge accounting dedesignation must be handled in coordination with accounting to ensure proper recognition of gains or losses upon unwind, including reclassification from other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges.

  reasons: ['exposure-reduced', 'ineffective', 'strategy-change'],
  portfolio: 'commodity-hedges'
