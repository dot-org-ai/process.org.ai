# Monitor credit

> Business-as-Code definition for credit. Models the end-to-end process of monitor credit as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Monitoring credit within the hedging transaction context involves tracking the creditworthiness of derivative counterparties to ensure the organization's hedge positions do not create unacceptable counterparty credit risk. This includes reviewing external credit ratings and CDS spreads for each counterparty, calculating current and potential future credit exposure from outstanding derivative positions, monitoring compliance with ISDA credit support annex thresholds, and flagging counterparties showing signs of credit deterioration. Proactive credit monitoring enables treasury to reduce exposure to weakening counterparties before default, through position reduction, collateral calls, or counterparty substitution.
