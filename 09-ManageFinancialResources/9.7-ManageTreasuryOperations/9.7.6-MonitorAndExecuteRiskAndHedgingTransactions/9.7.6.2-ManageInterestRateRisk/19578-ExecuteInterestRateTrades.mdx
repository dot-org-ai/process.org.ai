# Execute interest rate trades

> Business-as-Code definition for interest rate trades. Models the end-to-end process of execute interest rate trades as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Executing interest rate trades involves placing swap, cap, floor, and other interest rate derivative orders with approved counterparties based on the hedge requirements determined by the risk team. The dealer solicits competitive quotes from multiple counterparties, selects the best pricing, and confirms trade terms including notional amounts, fixed and floating rate specifications, payment frequencies, and maturity dates. Post-execution, the trade is confirmed with the counterparty, recorded in the treasury management system, and handed off to operations for settlement processing.
