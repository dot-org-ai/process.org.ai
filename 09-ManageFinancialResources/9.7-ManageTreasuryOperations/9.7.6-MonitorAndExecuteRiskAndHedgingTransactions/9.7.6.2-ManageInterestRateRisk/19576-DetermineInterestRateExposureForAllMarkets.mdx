# Determine interest rate exposure for all markets

> Business-as-Code definition for interest rate exposure for all markets. Models the end-to-end process of determine interest rate exposure for all markets as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Determining interest rate exposure for all markets quantifies the organization's sensitivity to interest rate movements across every currency and market in which it holds positions. This involves mapping all floating-rate assets and liabilities, fixed-rate instruments subject to repricing, and derivative positions to calculate net exposure by tenor bucket. Duration analysis, basis point value calculations, and scenario-based sensitivity modeling are performed to produce a comprehensive view of how parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts would affect the organization's net interest income and economic value of equity.
