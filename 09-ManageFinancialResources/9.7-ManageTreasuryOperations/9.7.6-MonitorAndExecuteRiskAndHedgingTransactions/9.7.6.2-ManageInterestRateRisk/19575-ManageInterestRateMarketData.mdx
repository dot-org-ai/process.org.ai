# Manage interest rate market data

> Business-as-Code definition for interest rate market data. Models the end-to-end process of manage interest rate market data as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Managing interest rate market data involves sourcing, validating, and maintaining the benchmark yield curves, reference rates, and volatility surfaces that treasury uses to value interest rate exposures and derivative positions. This includes subscribing to real-time feeds from data vendors, constructing and interpolating yield curves across multiple tenors and currencies, and archiving historical rate snapshots for trend analysis and model backtesting. Accurate and timely market data is foundational to all downstream interest rate risk quantification and hedging decisions.

const curves = await client.constructYieldCurves({
  asOfDate: '2025-03-15',
  currencies: ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP'],
  benchmarks: ['SOFR', 'EURIBOR', 'SONIA']
})

// Validate incoming rate data for anomalies
const validation = await client.validateRateData({
  feedId: 'bloomberg-rates',
  date: '2025-03-15',
