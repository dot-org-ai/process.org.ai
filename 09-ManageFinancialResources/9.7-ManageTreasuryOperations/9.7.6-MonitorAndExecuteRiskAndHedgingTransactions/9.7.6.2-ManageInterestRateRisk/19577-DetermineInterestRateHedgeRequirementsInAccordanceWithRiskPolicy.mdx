# Determine interest rate hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy

> Business-as-Code definition for interest rate hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy. Models the end-to-end process of determine interest rate hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Determining interest rate hedge requirements translates measured exposures into specific hedging actions aligned with the organization's approved risk policy. This task compares current net interest rate exposure by tenor bucket against policy-defined tolerance limits, identifies gaps where exposure exceeds acceptable thresholds, and calculates the notional amounts, instrument types, and tenors required to bring exposures within bounds. The output is a hedge requirement recommendation that specifies swaps, caps, or floors needed, which feeds directly into the trade execution process.
