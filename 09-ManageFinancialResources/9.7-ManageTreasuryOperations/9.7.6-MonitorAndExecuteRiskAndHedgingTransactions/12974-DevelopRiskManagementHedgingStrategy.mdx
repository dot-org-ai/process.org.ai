# Develop risk management/hedging strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for risk management and hedging strategy development. Models the assessment of financial risk exposures and the design of hedging programs using derivatives, futures, and options to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity price risks.

## Overview

Developing a risk management and hedging strategy involves assessing the organization's financial risk exposures across interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity price categories, and designing structured hedging programs to mitigate those risks within approved tolerance levels. The process defines risk appetite thresholds, selects appropriate derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, and options, and structures the overall hedging program with target hedge ratios, tenors, and rollover schedules. The completed strategy is presented to the treasury committee or board for formal approval and serves as the governing framework for all subsequent hedging execution activities.
