# Manage foreign exchange market data

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign exchange market data. Models the end-to-end process of manage foreign exchange market data as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Managing foreign exchange market data involves sourcing, validating, and distributing real-time and closing exchange rates, forward points, and implied volatility surfaces for all currency pairs in which the organization transacts. This includes subscribing to data feeds from approved FX data vendors, validating spot and forward rates against multiple sources to detect stale or erroneous quotes, and maintaining historical rate archives for valuations and trend analysis. Accurate FX market data underpins exposure quantification, hedge valuation, and balance sheet translation for international operations.
