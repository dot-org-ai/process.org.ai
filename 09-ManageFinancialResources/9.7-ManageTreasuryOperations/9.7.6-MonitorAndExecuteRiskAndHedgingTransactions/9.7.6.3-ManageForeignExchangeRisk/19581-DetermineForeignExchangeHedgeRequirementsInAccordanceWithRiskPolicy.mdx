# Determine foreign exchange hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign exchange hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy. Models the end-to-end process of determine foreign exchange hedge requirements in accordance with risk policy as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Determining foreign exchange hedge requirements translates measured currency exposures into actionable hedge specifications that comply with the organization's risk policy. This task compares net FX exposure by currency pair against approved tolerance limits, identifies where exposures exceed policy thresholds, and specifies the forward contracts, options, or cross-currency swaps required to bring positions within acceptable bounds. The output includes recommended hedge notionals, tenors, and instrument types for each currency pair, structured to achieve the target hedge ratio defined in the risk management strategy while considering hedging costs and market liquidity.
