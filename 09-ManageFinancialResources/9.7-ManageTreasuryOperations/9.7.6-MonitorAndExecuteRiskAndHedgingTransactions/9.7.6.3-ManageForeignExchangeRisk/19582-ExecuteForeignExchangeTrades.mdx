# Execute foreign exchange trades

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign exchange trades. Models the end-to-end process of execute foreign exchange trades as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Executing foreign exchange trades involves placing spot, forward, option, and swap orders with approved FX counterparties to fulfill hedge requirements or support operational currency needs. The FX dealer solicits competitive quotes from multiple banks, selects the best execution based on pricing, credit exposure, and counterparty limits, and confirms trade details including exchange rates, notional amounts, value dates, and settlement instructions. Completed trades are recorded in the treasury management system and handed off to operations for settlement processing and to accounting for hedge designation.
