# Manage foreign exchange balance sheet risk

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign exchange balance sheet risk. Models the end-to-end process of manage foreign exchange balance sheet risk as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Managing foreign exchange balance sheet risk addresses the translational exposure that arises when consolidating foreign subsidiary financial statements into the parent company's reporting currency. This includes identifying net asset and liability positions denominated in foreign currencies on the balance sheet, quantifying the impact of exchange rate movements on reported equity through cumulative translation adjustments, and executing balance sheet hedges to minimize period-over-period volatility in reported results. The process requires close coordination with subsidiary controllers to obtain accurate local-currency balance sheet data and with accounting to ensure proper treatment under ASC 830 or IAS 21.
