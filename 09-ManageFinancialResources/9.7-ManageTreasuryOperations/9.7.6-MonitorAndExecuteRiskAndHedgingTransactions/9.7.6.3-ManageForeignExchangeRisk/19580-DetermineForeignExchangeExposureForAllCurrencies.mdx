# Determine foreign exchange exposure for all currencies

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign exchange exposure for all currencies. Models the end-to-end process of determine foreign exchange exposure for all currencies as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Determining foreign exchange exposure for all currencies involves aggregating and quantifying the organization's net currency positions across all business units, subsidiaries, and financial instruments. This includes mapping transactional exposures from forecasted receipts and payments in foreign currencies, translational exposures from consolidating foreign subsidiary financial statements, and economic exposures from competitive dynamics affected by currency movements. The process produces a comprehensive FX exposure report by currency pair that drives hedge requirement calculations and supports management visibility into total currency risk.
