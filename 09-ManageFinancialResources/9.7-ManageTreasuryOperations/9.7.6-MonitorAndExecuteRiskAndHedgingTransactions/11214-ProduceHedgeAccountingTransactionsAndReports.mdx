# Produce hedge accounting transactions and reports

> Business-as-Code definition for hedge accounting and reporting. Models the documentation, effectiveness testing, and financial reporting of hedging relationships under ASC 815 and IFRS 9, including journal entries for fair value and cash flow hedges.

## Overview

Producing hedge accounting transactions and reports covers the formal documentation, effectiveness testing, and financial reporting of hedging relationships under applicable accounting standards such as ASC 815 and IFRS 9. This includes preparing hedge designation documentation that establishes the risk being hedged, the hedging instrument, and the assessment methodology. Prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests are performed each reporting period, and journal entries are generated to record fair value changes, cash flow hedge deferrals, and settlement amounts. Hedge accounting disclosures are compiled for financial statement footnotes and reconciled against trading system positions to ensure accuracy.
