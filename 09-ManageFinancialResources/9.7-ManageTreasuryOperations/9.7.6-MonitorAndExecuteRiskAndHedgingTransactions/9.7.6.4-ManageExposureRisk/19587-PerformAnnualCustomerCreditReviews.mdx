# Perform annual customer credit reviews

> Business-as-Code definition for annual customer credit reviews. Models the end-to-end process of perform annual customer credit reviews as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Performing annual customer credit reviews involves a comprehensive reassessment of each customer's creditworthiness, financial condition, and payment history to determine whether current credit limits and terms remain appropriate. The review analyzes updated financial statements, external credit ratings, industry conditions, and the customer's payment track record to produce a revised internal credit rating and limit recommendation. Reviews may result in limit increases for improving credits, limit reductions or enhanced collateral requirements for deteriorating credits, or continuation of existing terms. Completed reviews are documented and approved by the credit committee to maintain a current and defensible credit portfolio.
