# Determine current customer exposures and limit exceptions

> Business-as-Code definition for current customer exposures and limit exceptions. Models the end-to-end process of determine current customer exposures and limit exceptions as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Determining current customer exposures and limit exceptions involves calculating the total credit exposure to each customer or counterparty across all product lines and transaction types, then comparing these against approved credit limits. This includes aggregating outstanding receivables, derivative mark-to-market values, contingent liabilities, and committed facilities to produce a consolidated exposure view per customer. Where exposures exceed or approach approved limits, the process identifies and documents limit exceptions for escalation to credit officers and senior management for resolution or temporary limit approval.

const exposure = await client.aggregateCustomerExposure({
  customerId: 'CUST-2025-0451',
  asOfDate: '2025-03-15',
  includeContingent: true
})

// Compare all customer exposures against limits and flag exceptions
const exceptions = await client.compareExposureToLimits({
  asOfDate: '2025-03-15',
  alertThreshold: 0.85,
  customerSegment: 'corporate'
})
