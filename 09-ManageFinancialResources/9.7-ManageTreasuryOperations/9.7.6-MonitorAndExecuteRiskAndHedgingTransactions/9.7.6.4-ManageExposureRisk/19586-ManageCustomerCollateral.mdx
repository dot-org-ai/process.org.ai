# Manage customer collateral

> Business-as-Code definition for customer collateral. Models the end-to-end process of manage customer collateral as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Managing customer collateral involves tracking, valuing, and administering the securities, cash deposits, letters of credit, and other assets pledged by customers to secure credit exposures. This includes onboarding new collateral agreements, performing regular mark-to-market valuations of pledged assets, monitoring collateral coverage ratios against minimum thresholds, and issuing margin calls when coverage falls below required levels. The process also handles collateral substitutions, returns upon exposure reduction, and liquidation procedures when customers default on obligations. Effective collateral management reduces the organization's net credit exposure and supports regulatory capital optimization.
