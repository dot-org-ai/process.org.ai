# Resolve customer exposure limit violations

> Business-as-Code definition for customer exposure limit violations. Models the end-to-end process of resolve customer exposure limit violations as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Resolving customer exposure limit violations involves investigating and remediating situations where a customer's total credit exposure has exceeded approved limits. This may involve negotiating position reductions, obtaining temporary limit increases from the credit committee, requesting additional collateral, or restricting new transactions until exposure returns to compliant levels. Each violation is tracked through a formal case workflow that documents the root cause, remediation actions taken, timeline for resolution, and approval of any temporary limit exceptions. The goal is to bring all customer exposures back within approved policy bounds while maintaining productive business relationships.
