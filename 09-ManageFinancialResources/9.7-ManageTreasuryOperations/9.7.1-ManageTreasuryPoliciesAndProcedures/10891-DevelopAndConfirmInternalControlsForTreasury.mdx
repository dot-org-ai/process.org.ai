# Develop and confirm internal controls for treasury

> Business-as-Code definition for treasury internal controls development. Models the design, implementation, and validation of internal control mechanisms for treasury operations including segregation of duties and transaction authorization.

## Overview

Designing, implementing, and validating internal control mechanisms for treasury operations including segregation of duties, transaction authorization limits, and reconciliation checkpoints. Controls are tested for both design adequacy and operating effectiveness to ensure they mitigate key risks such as unauthorized transactions, data integrity failures, and fraud. The process supports SOX compliance and provides assurance to auditors and regulators that treasury activities are properly safeguarded.

const controls = developAndConfirmInternalControlsForTreasury()

// Design a new treasury control for wire transfer authorization
const control = await controls.designTreasuryControl({
  riskArea: 'unauthorized-wire-transfers',
  controlType: 'preventive',
  frequency: 'per-transaction',
  evidence: 'dual-authorization-log',
  owner: 'EFTOperationsManager'
})

// Retrieve control test results for the treasury function
const testResults = await controls.getControlTestResults({
  testingPeriod: '2025-Q1',
  riskArea: 'all',
  includeDeficiencies: true
})
```
