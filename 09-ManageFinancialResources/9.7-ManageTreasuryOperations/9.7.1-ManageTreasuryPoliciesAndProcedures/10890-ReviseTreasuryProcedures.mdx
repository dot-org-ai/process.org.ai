# Revise treasury procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for treasury procedure revision. Models the assessment, update, and re-publication of treasury procedures based on audit findings, regulatory changes, or operational improvements.

## Overview

Evaluating, updating, and re-publishing treasury procedures in response to audit findings, regulatory changes, operational incidents, or technology upgrades. The revision process ensures that documented procedures remain accurate, effective, and aligned with current policies and market practices. Each revision undergoes management re-approval before distribution, and personnel are notified of changes to maintain consistent operational execution.
