# Define system security requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for treasury system security requirements. Models the specification of access controls, data protection standards, system authentication, and security monitoring for treasury management systems.

## Overview

Specifying access controls, data protection standards, authentication mechanisms, and security monitoring requirements for treasury management systems. This includes defining role-based access permissions, multi-factor authentication rules, encryption standards for sensitive financial data, and incident response procedures. The process ensures that treasury systems protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats while maintaining the availability and integrity of financial transaction processing.

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineSystemSecurityRequirements } from '@headlessly/define-system-security-requirements'

const security = defineSystemSecurityRequirements()

// Specify role-based access controls for the treasury management system
const accessControls = await security.specifyAccessControls({
  system: 'treasury-management-system',
  roles: ['Treasurer', 'CashManager', 'TreasuryAnalyst', 'ReadOnlyAuditor'],
  enforceSegregation: true,
  reviewCycle: 'quarterly'
})

// Query current user access rights for audit purposes
const permissions = await security.getAccessPermissions({
  system: 'treasury-management-system',
  userId: 'all',
  includeLastAccessDate: true
})
```
