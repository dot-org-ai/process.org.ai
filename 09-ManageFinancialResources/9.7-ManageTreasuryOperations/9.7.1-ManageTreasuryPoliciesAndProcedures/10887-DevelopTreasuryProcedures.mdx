# Develop treasury procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for treasury procedure development. Models the creation of detailed operational procedures for executing treasury activities including cash management, investment placement, and bank account operations.

## Overview

Creating detailed operational procedures for executing treasury activities including cash management, investment placement, bank account operations, and payment processing. Each procedure translates high-level treasury policies into step-by-step workflows with defined roles, system interactions, and exception handling paths. The process includes validating procedures against real-world scenarios and obtaining management sign-off to ensure operational readiness.
