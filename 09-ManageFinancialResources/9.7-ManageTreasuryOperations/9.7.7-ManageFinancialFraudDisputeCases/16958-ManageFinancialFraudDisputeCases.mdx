# Manage financial fraud/dispute cases

> Business-as-Code definition for financial fraud and dispute case management. Models the detection, investigation, resolution, and reporting of suspected financial fraud and payment disputes within treasury operations.

## Overview

Managing financial fraud and dispute cases covers the end-to-end lifecycle of detecting, investigating, resolving, and reporting suspected financial fraud and payment disputes within treasury operations. This includes monitoring transaction patterns using rule-based and anomaly detection systems, conducting detailed forensic investigations when suspicious activity is flagged, determining case outcomes through evidence analysis, and applying corrective actions such as transaction reversals or account freezes. Confirmed fraud cases are escalated to law enforcement and regulatory authorities, while fund recovery efforts are initiated to reclaim misappropriated assets.
