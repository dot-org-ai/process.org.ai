# Manage in-house bank accounts for subsidiaries

> Business-as-Code definition for subsidiary in-house bank account management. Models the setup, maintenance, and administration of internal bank accounts that centralize treasury services for subsidiary entities within a corporate group.

## Overview

Setting up, configuring, and administering internal bank accounts that centralize treasury services for subsidiary entities within a corporate group. The in-house bank structure replaces or supplements external banking relationships by providing subsidiaries with accounts for payments, collections, and intercompany settlements. Account parameters such as currency, credit limits, and interest rate terms are configured to reflect transfer pricing policies and local regulatory requirements. Daily balance monitoring ensures subsidiaries maintain appropriate liquidity levels.
