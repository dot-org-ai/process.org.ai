# Manage central incoming payments on behalf of subsidiaries

> Business-as-Code definition for centralized incoming payment management. Models the receipt, identification, and allocation of customer payments collected centrally on behalf of subsidiary entities, including remittance matching and intercompany settlement.

## Overview

Receiving, identifying, and allocating customer payments collected centrally on behalf of subsidiary entities through shared bank accounts. The process matches incoming remittances to subsidiary customers and outstanding invoices, credits the appropriate in-house bank accounts, and generates collection reports for subsidiary finance teams. Centralized collection reduces the number of external bank accounts, simplifies bank reconciliation, and provides consolidated visibility into group-wide receivables performance.
