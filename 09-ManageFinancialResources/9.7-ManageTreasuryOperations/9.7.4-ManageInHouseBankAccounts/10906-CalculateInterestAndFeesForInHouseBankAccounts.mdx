# Calculate interest and fees for in-house bank accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for in-house bank interest and fee calculation. Models the computation of internal interest charges, credits, and service fees applied to subsidiary in-house bank accounts based on agreed transfer pricing rates and service level agreements.

## Overview

Computing daily interest accruals, applying transfer pricing rates, and calculating service fees for subsidiary in-house bank accounts based on agreed terms and actual account activity. Interest calculations follow arm's-length pricing principles to satisfy tax and regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Monthly interest and fee statements are generated for each subsidiary and corresponding journal entries are posted to the general ledger, ensuring accurate intercompany accounting and transfer pricing compliance.
