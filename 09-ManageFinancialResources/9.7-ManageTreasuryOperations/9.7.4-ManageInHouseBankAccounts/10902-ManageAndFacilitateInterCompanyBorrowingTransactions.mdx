# Manage and facilitate inter-company borrowing transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for intercompany borrowing transaction management. Models the origination, execution, and servicing of internal loans between corporate entities through the in-house bank, including arm's-length rate determination and transfer pricing compliance.

## Overview

Originating, executing, and servicing internal loans between corporate entities through the in-house bank, replacing or supplementing external borrowing with lower-cost intercompany financing. The process includes determining arm's-length interest rates to satisfy transfer pricing regulations, obtaining appropriate approvals, and processing loan drawdowns and repayments through subsidiary in-house bank accounts. Proper documentation and rate-setting ensure compliance with tax authorities across multiple jurisdictions.
