# Provide account statements for in-house bank accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for in-house bank account statement provision. Models the generation, distribution, and reconciliation of periodic account statements for subsidiary in-house bank accounts, including transaction details, balance summaries, and interest calculations.

## Overview

Generating, distributing, and supporting reconciliation of periodic account statements for subsidiary in-house bank accounts. Each statement includes detailed transaction history, opening and closing balances, average balance calculations, and interest and fee accruals for the period. Timely statement delivery enables subsidiary finance teams to reconcile their local records against centralized in-house bank data, maintaining accuracy across the corporate group's intercompany accounting.
