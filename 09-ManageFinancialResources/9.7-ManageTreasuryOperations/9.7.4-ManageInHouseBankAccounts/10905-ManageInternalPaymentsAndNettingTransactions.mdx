# Manage internal payments and netting transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for internal payment and netting transaction management. Models the multilateral netting of intercompany receivables and payables to minimize gross payment flows, reduce foreign exchange exposure, and lower transaction costs across a corporate group.

## Overview

Performing multilateral netting of intercompany receivables and payables to minimize gross payment flows, reduce foreign exchange exposure, and lower transaction costs across a corporate group. Each netting cycle collects intercompany positions from all entities, computes net settlement amounts, obtains entity confirmations, and executes settlements through in-house bank accounts. Effective netting significantly reduces the number and value of cross-border payments, yielding substantial savings in banking fees and currency conversion costs.
