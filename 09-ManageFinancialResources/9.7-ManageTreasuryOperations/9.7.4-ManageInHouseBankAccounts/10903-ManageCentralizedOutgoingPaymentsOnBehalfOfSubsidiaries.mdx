# Manage centralized outgoing payments on behalf of subsidiaries

> Business-as-Code definition for centralized outgoing payment management. Models the execution of vendor and supplier payments through a central payment factory on behalf of subsidiary entities, including payment aggregation, currency conversion, and intercompany settlement.

## Overview

Executing vendor and supplier payments through a central payment factory on behalf of subsidiary entities to achieve economies of scale, standardized controls, and reduced banking costs. The process aggregates payment requests from subsidiaries, validates instructions against approved beneficiary lists, processes consolidated payment batches through banking channels, and allocates costs to subsidiary in-house bank accounts. Centralization improves straight-through processing rates and enables better negotiation leverage with banking partners.
