# Determine sources and uses of capital

> Business-as-Code definition for capital source and use determination. Models the identification, evaluation, and allocation of internal and external funding sources against planned capital expenditures, operating needs, and strategic investments.

## Overview

Identifying and evaluating available sources of capital including retained earnings, debt instruments, equity issuance, and asset monetization. Mapping these sources against planned uses such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital, and debt repayment to create a balanced funding plan.
