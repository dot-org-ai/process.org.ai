# Discuss resolution with internal parties

> Business-as-Code definition for internal resolution discussion on revenue adjustments. Models the process of coordinating across departments to align on adjustment policies, dispute outcomes, and corrective actions.

## Overview

Discussing resolution with internal parties coordinates cross-departmental alignment on revenue adjustments that require input from multiple stakeholders before a final decision can be reached. This process involves convening resolution meetings with revenue accounting, sales, finance, and legal representatives, presenting dispute analysis and customer correspondence history, assessing the financial impact of proposed resolutions, and reaching consensus on the recommended course of action. Internal alignment is particularly critical for material adjustments that affect revenue recognition, margin reporting, or customer contract terms. The documented resolution decision provides authorization for downstream chargeback invoicing, journal entry processing, and any required policy updates.
