# Prepare chargeback invoices

> Business-as-Code definition for chargeback invoice preparation. Models the process of identifying pricing discrepancies, assembling supporting documentation, and generating chargeback invoices for cost recovery.

## Overview

Preparing chargeback invoices recovers costs when pricing discrepancies exist between contracted rates and amounts actually invoiced, typically when a supplier charges more than the agreed-upon price. This process involves identifying price variances by comparing invoiced amounts against contract terms, assembling supporting documentation such as purchase orders and price schedules, calculating the recoverable amount, and generating formal chargeback invoices for submission to the supplier. Timely chargeback processing directly protects margin and ensures that negotiated pricing agreements are effectively enforced. Tracking supplier response times and resolution rates provides visibility into vendor compliance and informs future contract negotiations.
