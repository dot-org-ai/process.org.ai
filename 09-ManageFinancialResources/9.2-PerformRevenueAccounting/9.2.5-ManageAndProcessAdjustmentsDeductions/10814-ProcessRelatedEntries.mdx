# Process related entries

> Business-as-Code definition for processing related journal entries from revenue adjustments. Models the recording, validation, and posting of debit and credit entries to maintain balanced accounts.

## Overview

Processing related entries records the debit and credit journal entries that arise from revenue adjustments, ensuring that the general ledger accurately reflects all approved modifications to customer accounts. This process involves drafting balanced journal entries, assigning correct GL account codes, validating that debits equal credits, posting entries to the ledger, and reconciling posted entries against source adjustment documents. Accurate and timely entry processing is essential for maintaining balanced books, meeting period-end close deadlines, and providing auditors with a clear trail from adjustment approval to ledger posting. Erroneous entries are corrected through reversing entries and re-posting, with each correction documented for the audit trail.
