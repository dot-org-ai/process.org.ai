# Analyze adjustments

> Business-as-Code definition for revenue adjustment analysis. Models the process of reviewing, categorizing, and validating account adjustments to ensure accuracy in financial reporting.

## Overview

Analyzing adjustments reviews, categorizes, and validates all account modifications to ensure they are accurately classified, properly supported by documentation, and within authorized thresholds before posting to the ledger. This process involves classifying each adjustment by type such as credit memo, rebate, or write-off, verifying amounts against contracts and source transactions, reconciling entries to the general ledger, and flagging anomalous adjustments that exceed normal patterns for additional review. Rigorous adjustment analysis prevents revenue leakage, detects potential fraud, and ensures financial reporting accuracy. The resulting reports provide management with visibility into adjustment trends, root causes, and the effectiveness of pricing and billing processes.
