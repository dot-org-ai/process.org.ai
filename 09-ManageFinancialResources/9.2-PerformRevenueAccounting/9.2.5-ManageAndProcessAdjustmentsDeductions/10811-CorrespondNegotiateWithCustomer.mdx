# Correspond/Negotiate with customer

> Business-as-Code definition for customer correspondence and negotiation on revenue adjustments. Models the process of resolving billing disputes, negotiating settlement terms, and formalizing agreed-upon adjustments.

## Overview

Corresponding and negotiating with customers on revenue adjustments involves direct communication to resolve billing disputes, pricing discrepancies, and unauthorized deductions that affect the organization's receivable balances. This process includes initiating formal dispute correspondence, reviewing the validity of customer claims against contracts and pricing agreements, proposing settlement terms such as partial credits or payment plans, and negotiating to reach mutually acceptable resolution. Efficient dispute resolution protects revenue, accelerates cash collection, and preserves customer relationships that might otherwise deteriorate over prolonged billing conflicts. Patterns in customer disputes also provide valuable feedback for improving upstream billing accuracy and contract clarity.
