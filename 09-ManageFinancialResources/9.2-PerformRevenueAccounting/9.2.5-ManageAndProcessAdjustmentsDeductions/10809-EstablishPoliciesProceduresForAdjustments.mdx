# Establish policies/procedures for adjustments

> Business-as-Code definition for adjustment policy and procedure establishment. Models the creation and governance of rules for processing credit memos, debit memos, pricing adjustments, and customer deductions.

## Overview

Establishing policies and procedures for adjustments creates the governance framework that controls how credit memos, debit memos, pricing corrections, and customer deductions are authorized and processed. This process involves categorizing valid adjustment types, setting dollar-based approval thresholds by role, defining rules for handling customer-initiated short-pays and deductions, and compiling these into documented procedures. Strong adjustment controls are critical for preventing revenue leakage and fraud, as adjustments directly reduce recognized revenue and receivable balances. The policy framework also ensures consistent treatment across the organization and provides the internal control structure required for financial audit compliance.
