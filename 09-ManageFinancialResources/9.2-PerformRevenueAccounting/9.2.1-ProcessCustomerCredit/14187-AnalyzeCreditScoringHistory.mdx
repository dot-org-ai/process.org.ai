# Analyze credit scoring history

> Business-as-Code definition for credit scoring history analysis. Models the review, trending, and assessment of historical credit scores to evaluate creditworthiness and support credit extension decisions.

## Overview

Analyzing credit scoring history involves reviewing and trending historical credit scores from both internal records and external bureaus to evaluate customer creditworthiness and support credit extension decisions. This process identifies patterns of score improvement or deterioration, assesses payment history and delinquency trends, and determines whether a customer's credit capacity supports additional credit lines. Accurate scoring analysis is essential for both new account applications and existing account reviews, as it provides the empirical basis for risk-based credit decisions. The output of this analysis also feeds forecasting models that project future portfolio risk and inform scoring threshold adjustments.
