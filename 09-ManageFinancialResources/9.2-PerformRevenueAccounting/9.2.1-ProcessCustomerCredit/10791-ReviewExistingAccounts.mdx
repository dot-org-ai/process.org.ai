# Review existing accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for existing account review. Models the periodic assessment of customer credit accounts including payment behavior analysis, limit adequacy evaluation, and risk reclassification.

## Overview

Reviewing existing accounts is an ongoing credit risk management process that ensures customer credit limits and risk classifications remain aligned with actual payment behavior and financial condition. This process involves extracting the account portfolio for periodic review, assessing payment timeliness, evaluating credit utilization ratios, and reclassifying risk tiers as needed. Proactive account reviews help prevent unexpected defaults by identifying deteriorating accounts before they become delinquent, and they also enable credit line increases for high-performing customers to support revenue growth. The review cycle typically runs quarterly or annually depending on account risk tier and outstanding balance.
