# Forecast credit scoring requirement

> Business-as-Code definition for credit scoring requirement forecasting. Models the projection of future credit scoring thresholds, exposure limits, and portfolio risk parameters based on economic conditions and business strategy.

## Overview

Forecasting credit scoring requirements projects the future credit score thresholds, exposure limits, and portfolio risk parameters that will govern credit decisions in upcoming periods. This process evaluates macroeconomic indicators, models expected default rates under various economic scenarios, and calculates optimal scoring cutoffs that balance revenue growth objectives against acceptable risk levels. Accurate forecasting enables proactive adjustments to credit standards before market conditions shift, preventing sudden spikes in delinquency or unnecessary restriction of sales. The resulting scoring requirements are distributed to credit operations and integrated into financial planning models for cash flow and reserve estimation.
