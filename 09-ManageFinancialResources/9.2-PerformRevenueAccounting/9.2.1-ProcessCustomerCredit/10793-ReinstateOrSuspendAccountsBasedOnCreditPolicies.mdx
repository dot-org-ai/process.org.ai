# Reinstate or suspend accounts based on credit policies

> Business-as-Code definition for account reinstatement and suspension management. Models the enforcement of credit policies through account status changes including suspension for policy violations and reinstatement upon compliance.

## Overview

Reinstating or suspending accounts based on credit policies enforces the organization's credit risk framework by controlling which customers can place new orders on credit terms. This process involves evaluating accounts against suspension triggers such as chronic late payment, credit limit breaches, or deteriorating financial condition, and then placing credit holds to prevent further exposure. When suspended accounts demonstrate compliance through payment plan completion or improved financial standing, credit privileges are restored through a formal reinstatement review. Consistent enforcement of these policies protects the organization from escalating bad debt while providing a structured path for customers to regain credit standing.
