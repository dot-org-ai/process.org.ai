# Analyze/Approve new account applications

> Business-as-Code definition for new account application analysis and approval. Models the evaluation of credit applications including financial review, credit scoring, risk assessment, and approval or denial decisions.

## Overview

Analyzing and approving new account applications is a critical revenue-enabling process that determines which prospective customers receive credit terms, directly affecting sales growth and credit risk exposure. The process involves validating applicant financial statements, calculating credit risk scores using internal models and external bureau data, and issuing approval, denial, or conditional decisions based on established credit policies. Timely and accurate application processing strengthens customer relationships while protecting the organization from excessive default risk. Each approved account generates a credit limit assignment that governs downstream invoicing and receivable management.
