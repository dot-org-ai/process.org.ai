# Establish credit policies

> Business-as-Code definition for credit policy establishment. Models the creation, approval, and maintenance of credit standards, payment terms, credit limits, and collection procedures that govern customer credit extensions.

## Overview

Establishing credit policies creates the foundational framework that governs how an organization extends credit to customers, directly influencing revenue growth and bad debt exposure. This process involves setting credit standards, defining payment terms and discount schedules, establishing tiered credit limits by risk classification, and documenting collection escalation procedures. Well-calibrated credit policies balance the need to drive sales with the imperative to minimize write-offs and protect cash flow. The resulting policy framework ensures consistency across all credit decisions and provides clear criteria for downstream processes such as account approvals, reviews, and suspensions.
