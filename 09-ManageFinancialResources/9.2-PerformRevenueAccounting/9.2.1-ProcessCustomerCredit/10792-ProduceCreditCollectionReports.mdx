# Produce credit/collection reports

> Business-as-Code definition for credit and collection report production. Models the compilation, formatting, and distribution of credit exposure, aging, and collection performance reports for management decision-making.

## Overview

Producing credit and collection reports provides management with the visibility needed to make informed decisions about credit exposure, collection strategy, and bad debt reserves. This process involves aggregating accounts receivable aging data, summarizing credit exposure by risk tier and customer segment, and computing collection effectiveness metrics such as days sales outstanding (DSO) and recovery rates. Timely and accurate reporting enables finance leadership to identify emerging risk concentrations, evaluate collector performance, and adjust credit policies proactively. These reports are typically produced monthly and serve as key inputs to financial planning, audit reviews, and board-level risk discussions.
