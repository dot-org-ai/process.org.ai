# Resolve customer billing inquiries

> Business-as-Code definition for customer billing inquiry resolution. Models the intake, investigation, and resolution of customer questions and disputes related to invoices, pricing, and payment terms.

## Overview

Resolving customer billing inquiries handles the investigation and correction of customer questions and disputes related to invoices, pricing, and payment terms. This process involves logging each inquiry with category and priority, researching the underlying invoice, order, and contract data to identify the root cause, proposing a corrective action such as a credit memo, rebilling, or explanation, and executing the approved resolution. Efficient inquiry resolution directly protects customer relationships and accelerates cash collection by removing payment blockers. High inquiry volumes often signal upstream billing accuracy problems, making root cause analysis a valuable byproduct of this process.
