# Post receivable entries

> Business-as-Code definition for receivable entry posting. Models the recording of invoice amounts as accounts receivable in the general ledger, including revenue recognition, subledger updates, and period-end receivable reconciliation.

## Overview

Posting receivable entries records invoice amounts as accounts receivable in the general ledger, establishing the formal financial claim against each customer. This process includes creating subledger entries for each invoice, recognizing revenue per applicable standards such as ASC 606, synchronizing the AR subledger with the GL control account, and recording period-end adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts. Accurate and timely posting ensures that revenue and receivable balances are correctly stated for financial reporting and supports reliable cash flow forecasting. Reconciliation between the subledger and general ledger at each period close is essential for audit readiness and internal control compliance.
