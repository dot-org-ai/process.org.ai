# Transmit billing data to customers

> Business-as-Code definition for billing data transmission. Models the delivery of invoices to customers through electronic, mail, or portal-based channels including format selection, delivery confirmation, and failed delivery handling.

## Overview

Transmitting billing data to customers is the delivery step that gets invoices into customer hands through the appropriate channel, whether electronic (email, EDI, portal) or physical mail. This process involves selecting the correct delivery method based on customer preferences, formatting invoices to meet channel-specific requirements, confirming successful delivery, and handling failed transmissions through retry or alternative channels. Timely and reliable invoice delivery is critical because it starts the payment clock and directly affects days sales outstanding (DSO). Organizations increasingly shift toward electronic delivery to reduce costs, accelerate receipt, and improve delivery tracking visibility.
