# Receive/Deposit customer payments

> Business-as-Code definition for customer payment receipt and deposit. Models the acceptance, validation, and banking of customer payments across all channels including checks, wire transfers, ACH, and electronic payments.

## Overview

Receiving and depositing customer payments is the cash intake process that converts outstanding receivables into collected funds in the organization's bank accounts. This process covers accepting payments across all channels including checks, wire transfers, ACH, and credit cards, validating payment amounts and remittance details, bundling verified payments into bank deposits, and recording deposit entries in the cash receipts journal. Timely payment processing directly reduces days sales outstanding and improves working capital position. Reconciliation of bank deposit confirmations to internal records ensures completeness and provides the audit trail necessary for financial reporting accuracy.
