# Post AR activity to the general ledger

> Business-as-Code definition for AR general ledger posting. Models the transfer of accounts receivable subledger transactions to the general ledger including invoices, cash receipts, adjustments, and write-offs.

## Overview

Posting AR activity to the general ledger transfers all accounts receivable subledger transactions -- invoices, cash receipts, adjustments, and write-offs -- into the general ledger control accounts. This process involves summarizing AR activity for the posting period, preparing balanced journal entries, posting them to the GL, and reconciling the AR subledger to the GL control account to verify completeness. Accurate and timely GL posting is essential for financial statement integrity, as the AR balance on the balance sheet must tie precisely to the subledger detail. Posting exceptions and discrepancies are investigated and corrected before period-end close to maintain audit readiness.
