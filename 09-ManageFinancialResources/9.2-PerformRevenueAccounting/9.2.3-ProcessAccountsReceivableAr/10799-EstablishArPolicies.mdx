# Establish AR policies

> Business-as-Code definition for accounts receivable policy establishment. Models the creation and maintenance of AR processing rules including payment acceptance methods, cash application procedures, write-off thresholds, and installment terms.

## Overview

Establishing AR policies creates the governing framework for how the organization processes customer payments, applies cash to invoices, handles write-offs, and manages installment terms. This process involves defining standard payment terms and early payment discounts, setting cash application rules for matching payments to invoices, establishing write-off authorization thresholds by dollar amount and role, and compiling these procedures into a formal policy manual. Well-defined AR policies ensure consistency across the receivables function, reduce processing errors, and provide the internal controls required for audit compliance. These policies also serve as the foundation for downstream processes including payment receipt, cash application, and AR reporting.
