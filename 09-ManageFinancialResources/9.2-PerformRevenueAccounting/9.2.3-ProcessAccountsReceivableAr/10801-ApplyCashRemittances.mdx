# Apply cash remittances

> Business-as-Code definition for cash remittance application. Models the matching of customer payments to open invoices, handling of partial payments, overpayments, and resolution of unidentified remittances.

## Overview

Applying cash remittances matches incoming customer payments to their corresponding open invoices, ensuring that customer accounts accurately reflect amounts owed and collected. This process handles the full range of payment scenarios including exact matches, partial payments where remaining balances must be tracked, overpayments requiring refunds or credits, and unidentified payments that need research before application. High auto-match rates from automated cash application systems significantly reduce manual effort and accelerate the order-to-cash cycle. Accurate and timely cash application is essential for reliable AR aging reports, customer statement accuracy, and effective collection prioritization.
