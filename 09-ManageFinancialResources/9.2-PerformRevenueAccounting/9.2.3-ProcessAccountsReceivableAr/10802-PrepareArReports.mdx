# Prepare AR reports

> Business-as-Code definition for accounts receivable report preparation. Models the compilation, analysis, and distribution of AR aging, DSO, cash collection, and bad debt reserve reports.

## Overview

Preparing AR reports compiles accounts receivable data into actionable reports that inform management decisions on collections strategy, cash flow planning, and bad debt reserve adequacy. This process involves generating aging reports by customer and aging bucket, calculating days sales outstanding, summarizing cash collection trends, and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss patterns. These reports are essential inputs to monthly close, financial planning cycles, and board-level risk discussions. Accurate and timely AR reporting also supports credit department decisions about which accounts to escalate, adjust, or write off.
