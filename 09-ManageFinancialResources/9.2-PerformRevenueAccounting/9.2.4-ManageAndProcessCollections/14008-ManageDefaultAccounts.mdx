# Manage default accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for default account management. Models the tracking, classification, and disposition of accounts that have breached their credit agreements, including referral to agencies or legal action.

## Overview

Managing default accounts handles the end-stage disposition of receivables where customers have breached their credit agreements and standard collection efforts have been exhausted. This process involves classifying defaulted accounts by severity, outstanding amount, and remaining recovery potential, then routing them to the appropriate disposition path including external collection agency referral, legal action, or final write-off. For accounts referred to agencies, ongoing monitoring of agency recovery performance ensures compliance with contractual terms and regulatory requirements. Effective default account management minimizes total bad debt losses while maintaining proper documentation for tax deductions on written-off balances and potential future recoveries.
