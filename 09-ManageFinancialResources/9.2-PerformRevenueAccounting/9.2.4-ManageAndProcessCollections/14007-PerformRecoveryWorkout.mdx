# Perform recovery workout

> Business-as-Code definition for recovery workout execution. Models the restructuring of payment terms for defaulted accounts including repayment plan design, compliance monitoring, and partial recovery tracking.

## Overview

Performing a recovery workout restructures payment terms for defaulted accounts to maximize the organization's cash recovery while providing the debtor a viable path to satisfy their obligation. This process involves assessing realistic recovery potential based on the debtor's current financial capacity, designing a modified repayment schedule with achievable milestones, formalizing the workout agreement with documented terms and debtor commitment, and monitoring compliance against the agreed schedule. Recovery workouts are typically pursued when the expected recovery exceeds what would be obtained through immediate write-off or external agency referral. Ongoing compliance monitoring is essential, as non-performance triggers escalation to legal action or final write-off disposition.
