# Correspond/Negotiate with delinquent accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for delinquent account correspondence and negotiation. Models the outreach to past-due customers through dunning notices, calls, and payment plan negotiations to recover outstanding balances.

## Overview

Corresponding and negotiating with delinquent accounts is the active outreach phase of the collections process, where collectors contact past-due customers to recover outstanding balances through dunning notices, direct calls, and structured payment negotiations. This process involves issuing collection letters per the dunning schedule, making direct contact to understand the customer's situation, negotiating payment plans or reduced settlements when full payment is not feasible, and documenting all communications for compliance and audit purposes. Effective negotiation maximizes cash recovery while preserving customer relationships where the business case supports continued engagement. Settlement authority levels and compliance with debt collection regulations such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act are critical governance considerations throughout this process.
