# Analyze delinquent account balances

> Business-as-Code definition for delinquent account balance analysis. Models the review and segmentation of past-due accounts by aging, balance, risk, and payment history to prioritize collection efforts.

## Overview

Analyzing delinquent account balances segments and prioritizes past-due accounts to focus collection resources on the highest-value recovery opportunities. This process involves classifying delinquent accounts by aging bucket, outstanding balance, and risk tier, reviewing historical payment patterns to assess recovery likelihood, ranking accounts in a prioritized collection queue, and evaluating the appropriate collection strategy for each segment. Effective delinquency analysis ensures that limited collection resources are deployed where they will have the greatest impact on cash recovery. The resulting trend reports provide management with early warning signals about portfolio deterioration and inform reserve adequacy assessments.
