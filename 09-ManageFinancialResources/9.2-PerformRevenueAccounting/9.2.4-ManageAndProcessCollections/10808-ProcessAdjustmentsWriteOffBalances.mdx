# Process adjustments/write off balances

> Business-as-Code definition for adjustment and write-off processing. Models the authorization, recording, and GL posting of bad debt write-offs, credit memos, and account balance adjustments for uncollectible receivables.

## Overview

Processing adjustments and writing off balances formally removes uncollectible receivables from the books through authorized write-off entries against the bad debt allowance reserve. This process involves preparing write-off documentation with supporting evidence of uncollectibility, securing approval at the appropriate authorization level based on dollar amount, posting the write-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts, and adjusting the reserve balance to reflect current write-off activity. Controlled write-off processing ensures that receivable balances accurately reflect realistically collectible amounts while maintaining the internal controls required for SOX compliance and audit readiness. Management reporting on write-off trends also provides feedback for credit policy calibration and reserve adequacy assessment.
