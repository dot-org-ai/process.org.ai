# Establish policies for delinquent accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for delinquent account policy establishment. Models the creation and maintenance of collection escalation procedures, dunning schedules, write-off criteria, and external agency referral thresholds.

## Overview

Establishing policies for delinquent accounts creates the collection framework that governs how the organization responds when customers fail to meet their payment obligations. This process involves defining dunning schedules with escalating notice cadences, setting aging and dollar thresholds for bad debt write-off authorization, establishing criteria for referring accounts to external collection agencies, and documenting the complete escalation workflow from first notice through legal action. Clear and consistently enforced delinquency policies protect the organization's cash position while maintaining compliance with debt collection regulations. These policies also provide collectors with structured guidance that improves recovery rates and reduces inconsistent treatment across accounts.
