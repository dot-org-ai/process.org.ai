# Discuss account resolution with internal parties

> Business-as-Code definition for internal account resolution discussion. Models the coordination between collections, sales, credit, and management to determine the best resolution path for delinquent accounts.

## Overview

Discussing account resolution with internal parties coordinates cross-functional decision-making for delinquent accounts that require alignment between collections, sales, credit, and finance before a resolution path can be pursued. This process involves convening resolution meetings, presenting the collection history and outstanding balances, evaluating options ranging from structured payment plans to settlements and write-offs, and securing management authorization for the recommended approach. Internal alignment is essential for high-value or strategically important accounts where the resolution decision has significant financial impact or customer relationship implications. The documented resolution decision provides the authorization and audit trail for downstream execution of adjustments, workouts, or write-offs.
