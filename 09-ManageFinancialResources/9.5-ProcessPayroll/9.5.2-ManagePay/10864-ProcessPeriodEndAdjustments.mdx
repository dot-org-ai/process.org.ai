# Process period-end adjustments

> Business-as-Code definition for period-end adjustments. Models the end-to-end process of process period-end adjustments as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Adjusting salary deductions, accruals, and payroll postings at the end of a pay period, quarter, or fiscal year. This process addresses retroactive pay corrections, bonus and commission true-ups, accrued vacation liability adjustments, and year-end tax reconciliation entries. Period-end adjustments ensure that financial statements accurately reflect compensation expenses and related liabilities, and that employees receive correct cumulative earnings and tax withholding totals for tax reporting purposes.
