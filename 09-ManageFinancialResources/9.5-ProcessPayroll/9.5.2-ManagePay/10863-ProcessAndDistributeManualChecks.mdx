# Process and distribute manual checks

> Business-as-Code definition for distribute manual checks. Models the end-to-end process of process and distribute manual checks as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Handling incorrect or omitted salary payments by issuing manual checks outside the regular payroll cycle. This process addresses situations such as missed direct deposits, terminated employee final pay requirements, retroactive pay adjustments, and emergency compensation needs. Manual check processing requires additional controls including dual authorization, off-cycle tax calculation verification, and reconciliation with the payroll register to maintain accurate records and prevent duplicate payments.
