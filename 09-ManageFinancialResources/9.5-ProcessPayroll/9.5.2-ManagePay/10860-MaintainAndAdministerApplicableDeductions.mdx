# Maintain and administer applicable deductions

> Business-as-Code definition for administer applicable deductions. Models the end-to-end process of maintain and administer applicable deductions as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Processing salary deductions for tax purposes and employee benefit elections. Keep and manage the details of every employee's salary deductions, including health insurance premiums, retirement plan contributions, garnishments, union dues, and voluntary withholdings. This process requires maintaining accurate deduction configurations as employees change benefit elections, receive court-ordered garnishments, or update voluntary contribution levels. Proper deduction administration ensures employees receive correct net pay while the organization meets its fiduciary obligations to benefit providers and government agencies.
