# File regulatory payroll tax forms

> Business-as-Code definition for regulatory payroll tax forms. Models the end-to-end process of file regulatory payroll tax forms as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Filing required payroll tax forms with federal, state, and local government agencies on quarterly and annual schedules. This includes preparing and submitting Form 941 (quarterly federal tax return), Form 940 (annual federal unemployment tax), and state-specific unemployment and withholding returns. The process requires reconciling tax deposits against calculated liabilities, ensuring all forms match previously remitted payments, and maintaining documentation to support regulatory audits and compliance reviews.
