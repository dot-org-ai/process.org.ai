# Develop tax plan

> Business-as-Code definition for tax plan. Models the end-to-end process of develop tax plan as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Devising a method to minimize payroll tax liability by means of allowances, deductions, exclusions, or exemptions while maintaining full regulatory compliance. This process involves analyzing current and projected tax obligations across all jurisdictions, evaluating pre-tax benefit program structures, and identifying strategies such as retirement plan matching, health savings account contributions, and qualified transportation benefits that reduce taxable payroll. The resulting tax plan provides a roadmap for optimizing the organization's total employment tax burden while ensuring employees benefit from available tax-advantaged programs.
