# Establish policies and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for policies and procedures. Models the end-to-end process of establish policies and procedures as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Developing policies and procedures for the HR function to calculate compensation, including rules for overtime eligibility, shift differentials, holiday pay, and leave accrual rates. These policies define the organizational standards for time reporting, approval workflows, and exception handling that govern the entire payroll cycle. Establishing clear, documented procedures ensures regulatory compliance with federal and state labor laws while providing consistent treatment of all employee compensation scenarios.
