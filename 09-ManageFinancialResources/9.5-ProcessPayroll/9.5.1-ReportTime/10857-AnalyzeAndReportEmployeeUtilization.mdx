# Analyze and report employee utilization

> Business-as-Code definition for report employee utilization. Models the end-to-end process of analyze and report employee utilization as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Monitoring the number of productive hours for employees relative to their available capacity and contracted hours. This process calculates utilization rates by comparing billable or productive time against total paid hours, identifying underutilization and overallocation across departments and roles. Utilization reports support resource planning, staffing decisions, and profitability analysis, particularly in professional services and project-based organizations where labor utilization directly impacts revenue.
