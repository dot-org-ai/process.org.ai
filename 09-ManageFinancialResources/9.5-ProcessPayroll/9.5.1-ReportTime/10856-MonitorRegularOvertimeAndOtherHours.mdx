# Monitor regular, overtime, and other hours

> Business-as-Code definition for regular, overtime, and other hours. Models the end-to-end process of monitor regular, overtime, and other hours as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Observing the number of hours worked by employees on a daily basis, with specific attention to overtime thresholds and premium-pay categories. Track the number of hours worked by an employee, as well as the number of hours worked beyond normal working hours according to company standards and applicable labor regulations. This monitoring ensures that overtime is properly authorized, double-time and holiday premiums are correctly applied, and managers have real-time visibility into labor costs to make informed staffing decisions.
