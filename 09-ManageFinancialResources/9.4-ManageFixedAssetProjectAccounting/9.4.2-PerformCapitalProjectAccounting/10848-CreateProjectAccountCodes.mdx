# Create project account codes

> Business-as-Code definition for project account codes. Models the end-to-end process of create project account codes as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Establishing unique reference codes and account structures for each approved capital project within the general ledger and project accounting systems. Each project account code maps to the chart of accounts hierarchy, enabling granular cost capture across labor, materials, equipment, and overhead categories. Properly structured account codes ensure accurate cost accumulation, facilitate budget-to-actual variance reporting, and support downstream capitalization and fixed-asset transfer processes.

  scope: 'enterprise'
})

// List all active project account codes for a given fiscal year
const codes = await client.getProjectAccountCodes({
  fiscalYear: 2025,
  status: 'active'
})
