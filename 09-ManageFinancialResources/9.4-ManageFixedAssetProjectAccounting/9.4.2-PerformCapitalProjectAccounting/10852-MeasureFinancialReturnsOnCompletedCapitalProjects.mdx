# Measure financial returns on completed capital projects

> Business-as-Code definition for financial returns on completed capital projects. Models the end-to-end process of measure financial returns on completed capital projects as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Comparing a finished project's profitability with forecasted returns from the original business case and financial justification. Scrutinize revenues generated by completed projects that required heavy investments, calculating actual return on investment, payback period, and internal rate of return against projected targets. Determine profitability and document lessons learned to improve the accuracy of future capital investment forecasting. This post-completion review closes the feedback loop between capital planning and realized financial outcomes.
