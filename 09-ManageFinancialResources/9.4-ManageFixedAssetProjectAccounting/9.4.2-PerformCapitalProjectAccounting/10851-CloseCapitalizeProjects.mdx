# Close/capitalize projects

> Business-as-Code definition for projects. Models the end-to-end process of close/capitalize projects as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Finalizing capital project accounting and transferring accumulated costs to the fixed-asset register upon project completion. This process involves reconciling all project-related transactions, verifying that costs meet capitalization criteria under applicable accounting standards, and reclassifying qualifying expenditures from construction-in-progress to depreciable fixed-asset accounts. Proper project closure ensures accurate asset valuations, triggers depreciation schedules, and releases unused budget allocations back to the capital pool.
