# Record project-related transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for project-related transactions. Models the end-to-end process of record project-related transactions as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Noting every transaction during a project in a common financial database. Document all transactions associated with any project, including purchase orders, vendor invoices, labor charges, and material requisitions. Maintain a centralized repository of all such financial data to support real-time budget monitoring and audit trail requirements. Accurate and timely transaction recording is critical for reliable cost reporting, variance analysis, and eventual asset capitalization at project completion.
