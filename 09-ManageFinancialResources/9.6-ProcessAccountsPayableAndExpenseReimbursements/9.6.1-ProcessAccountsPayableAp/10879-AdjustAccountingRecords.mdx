# Adjust accounting records

> Business-as-Code definition for AP accounting record adjustments. Models the identification, authorization, posting, and verification of correcting entries to accounts payable sub-ledger and general ledger records.

## Overview

Identifying, authorizing, and posting correcting entries to the accounts payable sub-ledger and general ledger to resolve recording errors, reclassifications, and discrepancies. This process handles corrections for duplicate payments, incorrect GL coding, pricing adjustments, and write-offs of uncollectible vendor credits. Each adjustment requires supporting documentation, proper authorization per the organization's approval matrix, and verification after posting to ensure the correction accurately resolves the original discrepancy.
