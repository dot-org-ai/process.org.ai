# Approve payments

> Business-as-Code definition for payments. Models the end-to-end process of approve payments as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Reviewing and authorizing vendor payment requests based on defined approval authority limits, budget availability, and policy compliance. This process routes invoices through single or multi-level approval workflows depending on payment amount and risk category. Approvers verify that goods or services were received, pricing matches contractual terms, and sufficient budget exists before authorizing disbursement. The approval process provides a critical internal control that prevents unauthorized or fraudulent payments.
