# Process payments

> Business-as-Code definition for payment processing. Models the end-to-end disbursement workflow including payment scheduling, method selection, authorization, execution, and confirmation of vendor and supplier payments.

## Overview

Executing the end-to-end disbursement of approved vendor payments through the appropriate payment channels including ACH, wire transfer, check, and virtual card. This process schedules approved invoices into payment runs based on due dates, discount eligibility, and cash position, selects the optimal payment method for each transaction, obtains batch authorization, and transmits payment instructions to the banking system. Post-disbursement activities include confirming vendor receipt and recording the payment in the general ledger.
