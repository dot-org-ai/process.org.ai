# Maintain/Manage electronic commerce

> Business-as-Code definition for electronic commerce. Models the end-to-end process of maintain/manage electronic commerce as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Administering the electronic commerce infrastructure that supports accounts payable transactions, including EDI connections, e-invoicing portals, and supplier network integrations. This process ensures that electronic trading partner agreements are current, transaction formats comply with standards such as cXML or EDI 810/850, and data flows securely between the organization and its vendors. Ongoing maintenance includes monitoring transmission errors, updating partner profiles, and onboarding new suppliers to electronic channels.
