# Retain records

> Business-as-Code definition for accounts payable record retention. Models the archival, indexing, and lifecycle management of AP documents including invoices, payment confirmations, and supporting documentation per regulatory retention schedules.

## Overview

Archiving, indexing, and managing the lifecycle of accounts payable documents including vendor invoices, payment confirmations, contracts, and supporting correspondence per regulatory retention schedules. This process ensures that AP records are stored in a searchable document management system, tagged with appropriate metadata for efficient retrieval, and assigned retention periods based on document type, jurisdiction, and regulatory requirements. When retention periods expire, records are securely destroyed following documented disposal procedures.
