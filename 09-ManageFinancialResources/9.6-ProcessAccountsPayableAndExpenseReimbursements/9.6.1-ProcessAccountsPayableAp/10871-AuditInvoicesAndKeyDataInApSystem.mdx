# Audit invoices and key data in AP system

> Business-as-Code definition for invoices and key data in ap system. Models the end-to-end process of audit invoices and key data in ap system as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Systematically reviewing invoices entered into the accounts payable system to verify data accuracy, completeness, and compliance with organizational policies. This process validates key fields such as vendor name, invoice amount, GL coding, tax calculations, and payment terms against source documents. Auditors check for duplicate entries, unauthorized charges, and data entry errors to prevent erroneous payments and ensure the integrity of the AP sub-ledger.
