# Process corporate credit card requests

> Business-as-Code definition for credit card request processing. Models the intake, eligibility validation, approval, and fulfillment of employee applications for corporate credit cards.

## Overview

Receiving, evaluating, and processing employee applications for corporate credit cards based on eligibility criteria, job requirements, and policy guidelines. The card administrator validates employment status, verifies manager approval, checks that the applicant's role qualifies for a corporate card, and determines the appropriate credit limit tier. Approved applications are forwarded to the card ordering process, while denied requests are returned to the applicant with documented rationale and appeal instructions.
