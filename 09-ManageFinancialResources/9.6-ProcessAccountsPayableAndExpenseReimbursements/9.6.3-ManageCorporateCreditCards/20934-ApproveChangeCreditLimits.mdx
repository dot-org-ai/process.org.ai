# Approve/Change credit limits

> Business-as-Code definition for credit limit approval and modification. Models the review, authorization, and implementation of credit limit changes for corporate cardholders based on business needs and spending patterns.

## Overview

Reviewing, authorizing, and implementing modifications to corporate credit card spending limits based on business justification, spending history, and role changes. This process handles both temporary limit increases for specific business trips or projects and permanent limit adjustments due to promotions, role changes, or ongoing business needs. Each request is evaluated against the organization's risk tolerance and approved limit tiers before being implemented with the card issuing bank.
