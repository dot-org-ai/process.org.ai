# Order corporate credit cards

> Business-as-Code definition for corporate credit card ordering. Models the card ordering, activation, and distribution process with the card issuing bank for approved cardholder requests.

## Overview

Placing and fulfilling card orders with the issuing bank for approved corporate credit card requests, including new card issuance, replacements, and renewals. This process coordinates with the card issuer to submit cardholder details, configure the card with the approved credit limit and merchant restrictions, track shipment and delivery, and activate the card for use. Secure handling procedures ensure cards are distributed only to authorized cardholders with proper identity verification.
