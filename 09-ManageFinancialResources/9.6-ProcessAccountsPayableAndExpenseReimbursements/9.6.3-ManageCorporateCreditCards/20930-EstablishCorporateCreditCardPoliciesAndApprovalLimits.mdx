# Establish corporate credit card policies and approval limits

> Business-as-Code definition for corporate credit card policy establishment. Models the creation and communication of card usage policies, merchant category restrictions, spending limits, and approval hierarchies.

## Overview

Developing and maintaining the policies, procedures, and spending parameters that govern the use of corporate credit cards across the organization. This process defines eligible expense categories, merchant category code restrictions, cardholder responsibilities, and receipt documentation requirements. Approval hierarchies are established to set default and role-based credit limits, ensuring that spending authority aligns with job function and organizational risk tolerance.
