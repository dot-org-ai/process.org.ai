# Cancel/Deactivate credit card

> Business-as-Code definition for credit card cancellation and deactivation. Models the suspension, deactivation, and account closure process for corporate credit cards due to termination, fraud, or policy violation.

## Overview

Suspending, deactivating, or permanently canceling corporate credit cards due to employee termination, role change, suspected fraud, or policy violation. This process coordinates with the card issuing bank to immediately block transaction processing, settles any outstanding balances or pending authorizations, and closes the account in the card management system. Emergency deactivation procedures enable same-day blocking for fraud cases, while standard deactivation follows the employee offboarding timeline to ensure all legitimate charges are captured before account closure.
