# Manage personnel accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for personnel account management within expense reimbursements. Models the maintenance of individual employee accounts tracking outstanding advances, reimbursement balances, and account reconciliation.

## Overview

Maintaining individual employee accounts that track outstanding cash advances, reimbursement balances, and expense-related receivables. This process reconciles advance disbursements against submitted expense reports, monitors aging of unreconciled balances, and initiates payroll deductions for overdue advances. Account administrators ensure that employee balances are accurate, produce periodic balance reports for management review, and coordinate with payroll to offset outstanding amounts upon employee termination or transfer.
