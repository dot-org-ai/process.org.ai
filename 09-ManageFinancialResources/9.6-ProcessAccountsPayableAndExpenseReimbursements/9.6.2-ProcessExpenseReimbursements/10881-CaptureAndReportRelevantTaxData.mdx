# Capture and report relevant tax data

> Business-as-Code definition for expense tax data capture and reporting. Models the extraction, classification, and reporting of tax-relevant data from employee expense transactions including taxable fringe benefits and deductible business expenses.

## Overview

Extracting, classifying, and reporting tax-relevant data from employee expense transactions to ensure compliance with tax regulations and accurate corporate tax filings. This process identifies taxable fringe benefits such as meals, entertainment, and personal use of company assets, as well as deductible business expenses. Tax data analysts apply correct tax codes, validate expense categories against IRS or local tax authority rules, and produce periodic reports that feed into the organization's payroll tax calculations and corporate tax returns.
