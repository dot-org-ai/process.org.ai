# Approve reimbursements and advances

> Business-as-Code definition for expense approval workflows. Models the review, validation, and authorization of employee expense reimbursement claims and cash advance requests against policy limits and budget availability.

## Overview

Reviewing and authorizing employee expense reimbursement claims and cash advance requests against organizational policies, spending limits, and budget availability. Approvers verify that submitted expenses are legitimate, properly documented with receipts, and fall within approved categories and per diem rates. The process supports multi-level approval routing for high-value claims and includes automated policy validation to accelerate routine approvals while flagging exceptions for manual review.
