# Establish and communicate expense reimbursement policies and approval limits

> Business-as-Code definition for expense reimbursement policy management. Models the creation, approval, publication, and communication of expense policies, per diem rates, and approval authority limits to employees across the organization.

## Overview

Creating, approving, and communicating the expense reimbursement policies, per diem rates, and approval authority limits that govern how employees submit and receive payment for business-related expenses. This process defines eligible expense categories, documentation requirements, spending thresholds by approval level, and the workflow for submitting and reviewing claims. Policies are distributed through mandatory training sessions, employee handbooks, and the corporate intranet, with annual reviews to ensure alignment with regulatory changes and organizational budget constraints.
