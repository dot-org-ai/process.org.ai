# Process reimbursements and advances

> Business-as-Code definition for reimbursement and advance payment execution. Models the payment processing of approved expense claims and cash advances through payroll integration or direct deposit.

## Overview

Executing payment of approved employee expense reimbursement claims and cash advance requests through payroll integration or direct deposit. This process schedules approved claims for the next payment cycle, validates bank account details, disburses funds to employees, and records the transactions in the general ledger. For cash advances, the process tracks outstanding balances and sets up recovery schedules to offset future expense reports against the advance amount.
