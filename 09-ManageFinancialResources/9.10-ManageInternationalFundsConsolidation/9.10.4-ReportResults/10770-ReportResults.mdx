# Report results

> Business-as-Code definition for international funds results reporting. Models the calculation and reporting of foreign currency translation gains and losses, intercompany elimination entries, and consolidated financial results.

## Overview

Documenting and reporting accounting entries to formally report financial gains or losses experienced as a result of foreign exchange activity. This process encompasses the calculation of foreign currency translation adjustments under ASC 830, the preparation of intercompany elimination entries, and the consolidation of multi-currency subsidiary results into the reporting currency. Accurate and timely reporting ensures that stakeholders understand the impact of currency movements on the organization's financial position.
