# Monitor international rates

> Business-as-Code definition for international rate monitoring. Models the tracking of foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and economic indicators across global markets to inform treasury and hedging decisions.

## Overview

Forecasting and monitoring changes in foreign currency value or interest rates around the world that play an important role in the organization. This process involves continuous surveillance of spot and forward exchange rates, central bank policy rate decisions, and benchmark interest rates such as SOFR, EURIBOR, and SONIA. The treasury team uses this intelligence to inform hedging strategies, optimize the timing of cross-border fund movements, and identify exposure thresholds that require immediate action.
