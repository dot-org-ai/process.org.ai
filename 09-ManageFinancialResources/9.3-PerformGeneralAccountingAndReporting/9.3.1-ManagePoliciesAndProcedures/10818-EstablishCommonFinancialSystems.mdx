# Establish common financial systems

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing common financial systems. Models the process of selecting, configuring, and deploying standardized ERP and financial platforms across the organization.

## Overview

Establishing processes and procedures to exercise financial control and accountability. Record, verify, and report transactions that affect revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities. A common financial system standardizes the chart of accounts, transaction processing, and reporting across all business units, reducing data inconsistencies and enabling efficient consolidation. System standardization also lowers total cost of ownership by eliminating redundant platforms and simplifying integration maintenance.
