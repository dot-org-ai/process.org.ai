# Establish accounting policies

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing accounting policies. Models the process of defining, documenting, and implementing accounting standards, methods, and measurement systems for financial statement preparation.

## Overview

Establishing policies and procedures to prepare financial statements, including methods, measurement systems, and procedures for providing disclosures. Accounting policies define the recognition, measurement, and presentation rules that the organization applies when recording transactions and preparing financial reports. These policies must comply with applicable GAAP, IFRS, or local statutory frameworks and be periodically reviewed to reflect new standards, regulatory changes, and evolving business practices.
