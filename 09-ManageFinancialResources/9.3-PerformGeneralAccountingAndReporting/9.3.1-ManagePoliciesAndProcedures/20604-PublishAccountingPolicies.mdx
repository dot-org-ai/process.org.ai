# Publish accounting policies

> Business-as-Code definition for publishing accounting policies. Models the process of formatting, distributing, and maintaining the accessibility of approved accounting policy documents for internal and external stakeholders.

## Overview

Creating a written copy of agreed-upon procedures for preparing financial statements, and making them available to the public. Publication ensures that all finance personnel have access to current policy versions, that external stakeholders can review accounting method disclosures, and that the organization maintains an auditable record of policy versions and employee acknowledgments. Timely publication is particularly critical when standards change, as delays can lead to inconsistent application across business units.
