# Set and enforce approval limits

> Business-as-Code definition for setting and enforcing financial approval limits. Models the process of defining authorization thresholds, configuring system controls, and monitoring compliance with approval hierarchies.

## Overview

Implementing parameters for accounting. Apply set conditions for any approval process. Approval limits define the maximum monetary authority granted to each organizational role, ensuring that transactions above specified thresholds receive appropriate management oversight before commitment. Properly configured approval limits reduce fraud risk, enforce segregation of duties, and create an auditable authorization chain across the organization.

  transactionType: 'purchaseOrder',
  levels: [
    { role: 'DepartmentManager', limit: 10000 },
    { role: 'Director', limit: 50000 },
    { role: 'VP', limit: 250000 },
    { role: 'CFO', limit: 1000000 }
  ]
})

// Audit approval compliance for the quarter
const audit = await client.auditApprovalCompliance({
  period: '2024-Q4',
  transactionTypes: ['purchaseOrder', 'journalEntry', 'expenseReport']
})
