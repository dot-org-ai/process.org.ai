# Process and record fixed-asset maintenance and repair expenses

> Business-as-Code definition for fixed-asset maintenance and repair expense processing. Models the classification, recording, and tracking of maintenance costs to distinguish between expensed repairs and capitalizable improvements.

## Overview

Maintaining a record of expenses necessitated for repairs and the preservation of assets. Administer and oversee the maintenance and repair of any fixed assets. Record all related transactions. The critical accounting judgment in this process is determining whether a cost is a routine repair (expensed immediately) or a capital improvement (added to the asset's book value), since misclassification can materially affect both the income statement and balance sheet.
