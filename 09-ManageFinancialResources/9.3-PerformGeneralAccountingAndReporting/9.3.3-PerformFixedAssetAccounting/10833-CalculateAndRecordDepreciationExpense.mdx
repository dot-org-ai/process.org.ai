# Calculate and record depreciation expense

> Business-as-Code definition for record depreciation expense. Models the end-to-end process of calculate and record depreciation expense as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Carrying out accounting for depreciation over fixed assets. Compute the sums necessitated. Maintain a record of the cost value of fixed assets over their useful life in the book of accounts. Accurate depreciation calculation ensures that asset values on the balance sheet reflect economic consumption, that income statements properly match expense to revenue, and that tax depreciation deductions are correctly claimed.
