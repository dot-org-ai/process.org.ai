# Establish (tax and book) depreciation policies

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing tax and book depreciation policies. Models the process of defining GAAP/IFRS book depreciation methods alongside tax code methods (MACRS, ACA), documenting book-tax differences, and ensuring consistent application.

## Overview

Establishing separate depreciation policies for financial reporting (book) and tax compliance purposes. Define approved methods, useful lives, and salvage values for each asset class under both book and tax frameworks to ensure accurate financial statements and tax returns.
