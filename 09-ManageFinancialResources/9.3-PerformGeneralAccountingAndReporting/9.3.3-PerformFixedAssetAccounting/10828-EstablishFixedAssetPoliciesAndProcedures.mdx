# Establish fixed-asset policies and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing fixed-asset policies and procedures. Models the process of defining capitalization thresholds, depreciation methods, impairment rules, and disposal procedures for property, plant, and equipment.

## Overview

Creating rules for fixed assets market valuation. Make rules and regulations for fixed assets regarding depreciation, provisions, resale, usage, and disposal. These policies define the minimum capitalization threshold, approved depreciation methods by asset class, impairment testing criteria, and procedures for asset retirement and disposal. Well-documented fixed-asset policies ensure consistent treatment across the organization, reduce audit risk, and provide clear guidance for determining whether expenditures should be capitalized or expensed.
