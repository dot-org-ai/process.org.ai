# Track fixed-assets including physical inventory

> Business-as-Code definition for fixed-assets including physical inventory. Models the end-to-end process of track fixed-assets including physical inventory as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Checking and updating the record of all fixed assets through ongoing location tracking and periodic physical verification. This process ensures that every asset recorded in the financial system physically exists, is in its documented location, and is in serviceable condition. Physical inventory counts detect ghost assets, unreported disposals, and location changes that would otherwise distort balance sheet values and depreciation expense.

const client = trackFixedassetsIncludingPhysicalInventory()

// Compare physical count results to the asset register
const comparison = await client.compareCountToRegister({
  location: 'HQ-Floor3',
  countDate: '2024-12-01',
  scannedAssetIds: ['FA-2020-00341', 'FA-2021-00112', 'FA-2022-00045']
})

// Retrieve unresolved discrepancies from the latest count
const discrepancies = await client.findAssetDiscrepancies({
  countCycle: '2024-Annual',
  status: 'unresolved',
  location: 'allLocations'
})
```
