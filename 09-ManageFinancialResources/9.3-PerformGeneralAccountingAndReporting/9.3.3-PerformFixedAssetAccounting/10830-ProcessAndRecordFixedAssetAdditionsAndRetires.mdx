# Process and record fixed-asset additions and retires

> Business-as-Code definition for fixed-asset addition and retirement processing. Models the capitalization of new assets and the disposal, sale, or retirement of existing assets including gain/loss calculations.

## Overview

Keeping a summary of sales and purchases of assets. Record any expenses made for new assets purchased and sales of any old assets during the fiscal year. This process evaluates whether expenditures meet the capitalization threshold, records new assets in the fixed-asset register with appropriate cost basis, and handles the financial impact of asset disposals including gain or loss calculations based on net book value versus sale proceeds.
