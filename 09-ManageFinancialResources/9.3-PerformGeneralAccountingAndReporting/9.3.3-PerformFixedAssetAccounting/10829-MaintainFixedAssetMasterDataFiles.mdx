# Maintain fixed-asset master data files

> Business-as-Code definition for fixed-asset master data maintenance. Models the process of creating, updating, and governing asset records including acquisition cost, location, useful life, and depreciation parameters.

## Overview

Keeping reports up-to-date regarding fixed assets. Create a fixed assets database detailing price, life cycle, depreciation rate, resale value, installation information, usage information, and custodian assignments. Accurate master data is the foundation for reliable depreciation calculations, physical inventory tracking, and financial reporting, since errors in asset attributes propagate into every downstream process from monthly depreciation runs to year-end tax filings.
