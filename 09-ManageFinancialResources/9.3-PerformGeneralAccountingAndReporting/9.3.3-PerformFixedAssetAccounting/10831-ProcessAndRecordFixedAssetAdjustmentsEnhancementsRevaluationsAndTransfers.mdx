# Process and record fixed-asset adjustments, enhancements, revaluations, and transfers

> Business-as-Code definition for fixed-asset adjustments, enhancements, revaluations, and transfers. Models the process of recording modifications to existing assets including capital improvements, fair-value revaluations, impairment charges, and inter-entity transfers.

## Overview

Keeping a summary of expenses for installing and modifying assets. Record any expenses incurred on improvements, the valuation of assets to reach current market price, and any transfers of assets from one location or entity to another during the fiscal year. Proper classification of these events is essential because capital improvements extend useful life and increase book value, revaluations adjust carrying amounts to fair value, impairments reduce assets to recoverable amounts, and transfers reallocate ownership across the corporate structure.
