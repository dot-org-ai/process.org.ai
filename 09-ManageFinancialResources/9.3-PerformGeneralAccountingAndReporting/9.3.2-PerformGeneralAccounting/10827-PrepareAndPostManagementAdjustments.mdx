# Prepare and post management adjustments

> Business-as-Code definition for management adjustment processing. Models the process of identifying, documenting, and posting top-side adjustments directed by management for financial reporting purposes.

## Overview

Accounting for changes due to country-level policy changes. Record adjustments made by management in the accounts. Management adjustments are top-side entries directed by senior leadership to reflect reserves, reclassifications, or corrections that are not captured through normal accounting processes. Because these entries originate outside standard transaction flows, they require enhanced documentation, explicit authorization by the CFO, and heightened audit scrutiny to prevent earnings manipulation and ensure financial statement integrity.
