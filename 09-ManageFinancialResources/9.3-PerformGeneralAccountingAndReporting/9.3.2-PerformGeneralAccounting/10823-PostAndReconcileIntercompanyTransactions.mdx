# Post and reconcile intercompany transactions

> Business-as-Code definition for intercompany transaction posting and reconciliation. Models the process of recording, matching, and settling transactions between legal entities within the same corporate group.

## Overview

Checking accounts separately for a parent and subsidiary company. Manage the financial relationship between a parent company and subsidiaries by recording, matching, and settling transactions between entities. Intercompany transactions include management fees, transfer pricing charges, intercompany loans, and goods transfers that must be reconciled and ultimately eliminated during consolidation to prevent double-counting of revenues and expenses in the group financial statements.
