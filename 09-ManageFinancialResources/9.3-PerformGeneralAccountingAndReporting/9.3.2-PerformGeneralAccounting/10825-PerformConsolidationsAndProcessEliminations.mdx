# Perform consolidations and process eliminations

> Business-as-Code definition for financial consolidation and elimination processing. Models the aggregation of subsidiary financial data, currency translation, minority interest calculation, and elimination of intercompany balances.

## Overview

Aggregating financial data from all subsidiary entities and eliminating intercompany transactions to present the corporate group as a single economic entity. This process involves collecting trial balances, translating foreign currencies, removing intercompany revenues, expenses, receivables, and payables, and calculating minority interest. Accurate consolidation is essential for producing reliable group financial statements that comply with GAAP or IFRS requirements and provide investors with a true view of the organization's financial position.
