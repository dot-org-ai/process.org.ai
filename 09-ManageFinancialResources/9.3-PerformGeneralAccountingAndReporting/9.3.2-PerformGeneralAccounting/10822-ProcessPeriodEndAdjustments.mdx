# Process period end adjustments

> Business-as-Code definition for period-end adjustment processing. Models the accrual, deferral, and reclassification entries required to accurately state financial results at month, quarter, and year-end close.

## Overview

Updating journal entries to adjust the balance of income and expenses at the end of an accounting period. This includes recording accruals for earned but unbilled revenue, incurred but unpaid expenses, amortization of prepaid items, and reclassifications needed to present financial results accurately. Timely and accurate period-end adjustments are critical to achieving a clean close, meeting reporting deadlines, and ensuring that financial statements reflect the true economic activity of the period.
