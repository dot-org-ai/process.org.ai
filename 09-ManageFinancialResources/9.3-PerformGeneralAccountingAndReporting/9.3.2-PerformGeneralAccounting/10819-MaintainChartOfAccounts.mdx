# Maintain chart of accounts

> Business-as-Code definition for chart of accounts maintenance. Models the process of creating, updating, and governing the hierarchical account structure used across the general ledger.

## Overview

Maintaining the hierarchical list of all accounts used in the general ledger. Alter accounts according to business requirements by adding new accounts, deactivating dormant ones, and updating account mappings. The chart of accounts is the structural backbone of the financial system, determining how transactions are classified, how financial statements are organized, and how management reports are segmented, making its governance essential for consistent and accurate financial reporting.
