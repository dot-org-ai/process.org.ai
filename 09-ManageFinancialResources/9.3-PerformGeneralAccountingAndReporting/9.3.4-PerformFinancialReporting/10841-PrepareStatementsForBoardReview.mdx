# Prepare statements for board review

> Business-as-Code definition for statements for board review. Models the end-to-end process of prepare statements for board review as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Preparing a draft of financial statements for the board to review before they are sent to the auditor. This process assembles the consolidated financial data, key management commentary, risk highlights, and supplementary analyses into a board-ready package. The board review ensures governance oversight of financial results, enables directors to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities, and provides an opportunity to identify concerns before external publication.
