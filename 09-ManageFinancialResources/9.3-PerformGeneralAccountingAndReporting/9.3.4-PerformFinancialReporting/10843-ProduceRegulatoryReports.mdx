# Produce regulatory reports

> Business-as-Code definition for regulatory reports. Models the end-to-end process of produce regulatory reports as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Reporting raw or summary data for final accounts following rules and regulations. This process encompasses the preparation and submission of financial reports required by government agencies, central banks, industry-specific regulators, and statistical authorities beyond standard SEC filings. Examples include bank call reports, insurance statutory filings, pension fund disclosures, and country-specific statistical returns, each with unique formats, deadlines, and data requirements that vary by jurisdiction and industry.
