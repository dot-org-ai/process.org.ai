# Prepare consolidated financial statements

> Business-as-Code definition for consolidated financial statements. Models the end-to-end process of prepare consolidated financial statements as a programmable workflow.

## Overview

Making final accounts for all units of a company together. Prepare combined financial statements of a parent company and its subsidiaries (separate legal entities controlled by a parent company) showing assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash flows. Consolidated statements present the financial position and results of the entire corporate group as if it were a single economic entity, eliminating intercompany transactions and incorporating currency translations, minority interests, and equity method investments.
