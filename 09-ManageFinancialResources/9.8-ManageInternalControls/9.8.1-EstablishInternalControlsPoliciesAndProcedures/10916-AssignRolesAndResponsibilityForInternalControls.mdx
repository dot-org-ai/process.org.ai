# Assign roles and responsibility for internal controls

> Business-as-Code definition for internal control responsibility assignment. Models the designation of control owners, testers, and escalation authorities for each control activity in the organization.

## Overview

Designating control owners, control testers, and escalation authorities for each internal control activity to ensure clear accountability throughout the organization. This process maps each control to the individual or role responsible for its execution, the manager accountable for its effectiveness, and the parties consulted or informed about results. The output is a comprehensive control ownership matrix that supports segregation of duties, enables timely escalation of deficiencies, and provides external auditors with clear lines of responsibility.
