# Define entity/unit risk tolerances

> Business-as-Code definition for risk tolerance definition. Models the establishment of acceptable risk levels by entity, business unit, and risk category to guide control design and monitoring.

## Overview

Outlining the risk tolerance levels of individual units, as well as the organization as a whole. Determine the specific maximum risk to take in quantitative terms for each relevant risk subcategory, including strategic, operational, financial, and compliance risks.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| establishRiskAppetite | Define the organization-wide risk appetite statement aligned with strategic objectives |
| quantifyToleranceThresholds | Set measurable tolerance limits for each risk category (strategic, operational, financial, compliance) |
| allocateToleranceByUnit | Distribute enterprise risk tolerances across business units based on their risk profile |
| validateToleranceAlignment | Ensure unit-level tolerances aggregate within the enterprise risk appetite |
| communicateTolerances | Distribute approved risk tolerance thresholds to all business unit leaders |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| riskAppetiteEstablished | Organization-wide risk appetite statement defined and approved |
| toleranceThresholdsQuantified | Measurable tolerance limits set for each risk category |
| toleranceAllocatedByUnit | Risk tolerances distributed across business units |
| toleranceAlignmentValidated | Unit-level tolerances confirmed to aggregate within enterprise appetite |
| tolerancesCommunicated | Approved risk tolerance thresholds distributed to business leaders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |

const client = defineEntityunitRiskTolerances()

// Retrieve the enterprise risk appetite statement
const appetite = await client.getRiskAppetiteStatement({
  version: 'current',
  includeApprovalHistory: true
})

// Query tolerance thresholds by business unit
const tolerances = await client.getToleranceByUnit({
  businessUnit: 'treasury',
  riskCategory: 'financial',
  includeBreachHistory: true
})
```
