# Define and communicate code of ethics

> Business-as-Code definition for ethics code management. Models the drafting, approval, distribution, and training of the organization's code of ethics and business conduct standards.

## Overview

Drafting, approving, and distributing the organization's code of ethics and business conduct standards to establish the behavioral expectations for all employees, directors, and contractors. This process defines policies on conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider trading, confidentiality, and whistleblower protections. The code is communicated through mandatory training, annual acknowledgment certifications, and accessible publication on the corporate intranet, reinforcing the tone at the top set by the board and senior management.
