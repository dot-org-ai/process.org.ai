# Define business process objectives and risks

> Business-as-Code definition for process risk assessment. Models the identification of business process objectives, associated risks, and the mapping of risks to control activities.

## Overview

Outlining the objectives and risks associated with a process. Delineate process goals. Determine the risks attached to it. Determine what the process is meant to accomplish, potential issues, a timeline of potential risks, the scope and potential impact of risks, etc.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| documentProcessObjectives | Articulate the key objectives each business process is designed to achieve |
| identifyProcessRisks | Catalog risks that could prevent business processes from meeting their objectives |
| assessRiskLikelihoodAndImpact | Evaluate the probability and potential severity of each identified risk |
| mapRisksToControls | Link identified risks to the control activities designed to mitigate them |
| prioritizeRiskMitigation | Rank risks by residual exposure to guide control investment decisions |

## Events

const client = defineBusinessProcessObjectivesAndRisks()

// Retrieve the risk register for financial processes
const risks = await client.getRiskRegister({
  processArea: 'financialReporting',
  riskLevel: 'high',
  includeControlMappings: true
})

// Assess risk likelihood and impact for a specific process
const assessment = await client.assessRiskLikelihoodAndImpact({
