# Report to regulators, share-/debt-holders, securities exchanges, etc.

> Business-as-Code definition for regulatory compliance reporting. Models the preparation and submission of internal controls compliance reports to regulators, securities exchanges, shareholders, and debt holders.

## Overview

Preparing and submitting internal controls compliance reports to regulators, securities exchanges, shareholders, and debt holders as required by applicable laws and listing requirements. This process gathers control testing evidence and management assertions, drafts formal regulatory filings such as SOX Section 302 and 404 certifications, and secures CEO and CFO sign-off on internal controls effectiveness attestations. Filed documents are submitted through regulatory portals such as EDGAR, and relevant disclosures are distributed to investors and debt covenant holders to satisfy transparency requirements.
