# Report to third parties

> Business-as-Code definition for third-party compliance reporting. Models the generation and delivery of controls compliance attestations to customers, suppliers, and business partners.

## Overview

Generating and delivering controls compliance attestations, SOC reports, and bridge letters to customers, suppliers, and business partners who require assurance about the organization's internal control environment. This process catalogs inbound attestation requests, coordinates SOC 2 Type II examinations with external auditors, prepares formal attestation letters, and distributes completed reports under NDA to requesting third parties. Timely fulfillment of these requests supports customer trust, enables contract compliance, and facilitates business partner due diligence processes.
