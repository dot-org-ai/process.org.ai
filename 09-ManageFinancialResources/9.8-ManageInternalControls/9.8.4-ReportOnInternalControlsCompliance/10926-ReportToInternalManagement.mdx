# Report to internal management

> Business-as-Code definition for internal management compliance reporting. Models the creation and distribution of controls status dashboards, finding summaries, and remediation updates to executive management.

## Overview

Creating and distributing internal controls status dashboards, control testing finding summaries, and remediation progress updates to executive management, the audit committee, and business unit leaders. This process compiles control testing outcomes and exception data, drafts executive-level compliance dashboards highlighting risk exposures and trending issues, and facilitates management briefings with documented decisions and action items. Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies are escalated immediately to senior management for urgent attention and remediation prioritization.
