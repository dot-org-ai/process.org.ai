# Implement and maintain controls-related enabling technologies and tools

> Business-as-Code definition for controls technology management. Models the selection, implementation, and maintenance of GRC platforms, automated monitoring tools, and compliance technologies.

## Overview

Selecting, deploying, and maintaining governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platforms, automated monitoring tools, and compliance technologies that support the internal control framework. This process evaluates technology solutions for automated control testing, continuous transaction monitoring, access control enforcement, and audit trail management. Ongoing maintenance includes applying system upgrades, configuring role-based access controls and segregation of duties rules, and ensuring that audit logging captures all control-relevant transactions across financial systems.
