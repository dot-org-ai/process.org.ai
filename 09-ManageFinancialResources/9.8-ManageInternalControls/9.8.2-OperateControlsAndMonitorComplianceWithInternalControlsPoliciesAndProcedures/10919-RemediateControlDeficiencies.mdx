# Remediate control deficiencies

> Business-as-Code definition for control deficiency remediation. Models the corrective action process for identified control weaknesses including root cause analysis, action planning, and validation.

## Overview

Executing the corrective action process for identified control weaknesses, including root cause analysis, remediation planning, implementation of corrective actions, and validation of effectiveness. This process prioritizes deficiencies by severity, developing formal action plans with milestones, owners, and target completion dates for each identified issue. Process owners implement the approved remediation steps while internal audit validates that the remediated control now operates as intended through re-testing, and progress is reported to the audit committee and external auditors.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| performRootCauseAnalysis | Investigate the underlying cause of each identified control deficiency |
| developRemediationPlan | Create a corrective action plan with milestones, owners, and target completion dates |
| implementCorrectiveActions | Execute the approved remediation steps to strengthen or replace the deficient control |
| validateRemediationEffectiveness | Test the remediated control to confirm it now operates as intended |
| updateControlDocumentation | Revise control narratives, flowcharts, and risk-control matrices to reflect changes |
| reportRemediationStatus | Communicate remediation progress and outcomes to audit committee and external auditors |
