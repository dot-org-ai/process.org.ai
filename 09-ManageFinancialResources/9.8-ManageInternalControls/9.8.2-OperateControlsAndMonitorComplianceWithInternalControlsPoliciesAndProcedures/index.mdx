# Operate controls and monitor compliance with internal controls policies and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for control operations and compliance monitoring. Models the design, implementation, testing, and remediation of control activities along with the creation and operation of the compliance function and enabling technologies.

## Overview

Incorporating planning, management, operations, and monitoring of internal control mechanism policies and procedures in order to manage internal controls. Design and implement control activities. Monitor control effectiveness. Remediate control deficiencies. Create compliance functions. Operate compliance functions. Implement and maintain technologies and tools to enable the internal controls-related activities.

## Usage

```typescript
import { operateControlsAndMonitorCompliance } from '@headlessly/operate-controls-and-monitor-compliance'

const controls = operateControlsAndMonitorCompliance()

// Test control effectiveness for segregation of duties
const testResult = await controls.testControlEffectiveness({
  controlId: 'SOD-AP-001',
  testType: 'walkthrough',
  sampleSize: 25,
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Remediate an identified deficiency
const remediation = await controls.remediateDeficiency({
  deficiencyId: 'DEF-2025-0042',
  correctiveAction: 'Implement dual approval for payments above threshold',
  targetDate: '2025-04-30'
})
