# Monitor control effectiveness

> Business-as-Code definition for control effectiveness monitoring. Models the ongoing testing and evaluation of whether internal controls operate effectively to achieve their intended objectives.

## Overview

Performing ongoing testing and evaluation of whether internal controls operate effectively to achieve their intended objectives throughout the reporting period. This process uses sampling, re-performance, and observation to test operating effectiveness, reviews control evidence such as approvals, reconciliations, and exception logs for adequacy, and classifies any identified issues as deficiencies, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses. Testing results are communicated to process owners and the audit committee to drive remediation actions and inform management's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.

  period: '2025-Q4',
  includeExceptions: true
})

// Retrieve the overall effectiveness scorecard
const scorecard = await client.getControlEffectivenessScorecard({
  businessUnit: 'all',
  period: '2025-12',
  groupBy: 'processArea'
