# Create compliance function

> Business-as-Code definition for compliance function creation. Models the establishment of the organizational compliance capability including structure, staffing, charter, and reporting lines.

## Overview

Establishing the organizational compliance function by defining its charter, mandate, organizational structure, staffing requirements, and reporting lines to the audit committee and senior management. This process includes cataloging all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, developing compliance policies and escalation procedures, and implementing reporting mechanisms such as whistleblower hotlines and incident management systems. The compliance function serves as the independent second line of defense responsible for monitoring adherence to regulations including anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, conflict of interest, and data privacy requirements.
