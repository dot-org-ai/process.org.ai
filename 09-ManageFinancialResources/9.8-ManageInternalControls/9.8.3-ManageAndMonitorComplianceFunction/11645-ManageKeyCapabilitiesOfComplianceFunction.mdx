# Manage key capabilities of compliance function

> Business-as-Code definition for compliance capability management. Models the development and maintenance of key skills, methodologies, and tools required for effective compliance program execution.

## Overview

Building and maintaining the core competencies, tools, and methodologies required for the compliance function to operate effectively, including professional development, technology adoption, and knowledge management. This process assesses capability gaps against required competencies, designs continuing education programs for compliance certifications and regulatory knowledge, and evaluates technology tools for monitoring and reporting. Maturity benchmarking against industry standards provides an objective measure of the function's effectiveness and identifies areas for targeted investment.
