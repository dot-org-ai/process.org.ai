# Manage organizational model and reporting relationships for compliance function

> Business-as-Code definition for compliance organizational structure management. Models the design and maintenance of the compliance function's reporting lines, committee structures, and independence requirements.

## Overview

Designing and maintaining the organizational structure, reporting lines, and committee memberships of the compliance function to ensure it has adequate independence, authority, and business unit coverage. This process defines the compliance function's dual reporting relationships to both executive management and the audit committee, establishes compliance committee charters and meeting cadences, and assigns embedded compliance liaison roles within key business units. Periodic effectiveness reviews assess whether the organizational model supports the compliance function's mandate and identify structural adjustments needed to address evolving risks and regulatory requirements.
