# Consolidate and optimize total tax plan

> Business-as-Code definition for total tax plan optimization. Models the consolidation of jurisdictional tax strategies into a unified plan and the optimization of the effective tax rate through structural and timing strategies.

## Overview

Combining and enhancing individual jurisdictional tax strategies into a unified, enterprise-wide tax plan that optimizes the overall effective tax rate. This process aggregates federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions to identify cross-jurisdictional efficiencies such as credit stacking, timing elections, and entity structure optimization. The consolidated plan aligns tax outcomes with corporate financial goals, cash flow targets, and strategic business objectives.
