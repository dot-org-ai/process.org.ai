# Maintain tax master data

> Business-as-Code definition for tax master data maintenance. Models the ongoing update of tax rates, entity structures, exemption certificates, and jurisdictional tax rules in the organization's systems.

## Overview

Maintaining the authoritative repository of tax rates, entity registration profiles, exemption certificates, and withholding rules used across the organization's financial systems. This process ensures that the tax engine applies current jurisdictional rates, that entity nexus and filing statuses remain accurate, and that sales tax exemption certificates are renewed before expiration. Reliable tax master data is the foundation for accurate tax calculations, return preparation, and compliance monitoring.
