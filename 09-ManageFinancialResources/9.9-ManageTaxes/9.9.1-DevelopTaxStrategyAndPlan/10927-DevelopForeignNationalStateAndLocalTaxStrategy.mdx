# Develop foreign, national, state, and local tax strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for multi-jurisdictional tax strategy development. Models the analysis and formulation of tax strategies across foreign, federal, state, and local jurisdictions to optimize the overall tax position.

## Overview

Developing a tax strategy for foreign, national, state, and local administration. This process involves analyzing the organization's tax nexus across all applicable jurisdictions, modeling the tax impact of different entity structures and election options, and identifying available credits and incentive programs. The resulting multi-jurisdictional strategy balances tax efficiency with regulatory compliance and supports the organization's overall financial objectives.
