# Account for taxes

> Business-as-Code definition for tax accounting. Models the recording of current and deferred tax provisions, tax payments, and tax-related journal entries in the general ledger.

## Overview

Recording current and deferred tax provisions, estimated payments, refund receivables, and tax-related journal entries in the general ledger. This process ensures that income tax expense is properly recognized in each reporting period using the annual effective rate method for interim periods. It also encompasses the reconciliation of tax-related GL accounts to supporting schedules, and the compilation of income tax footnote data for financial statement disclosure.
