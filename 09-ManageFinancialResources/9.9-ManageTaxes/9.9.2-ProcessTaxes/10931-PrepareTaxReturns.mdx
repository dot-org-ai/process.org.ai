# Prepare tax returns

> Business-as-Code definition for tax return preparation. Models the compilation, review, and filing of corporate income tax returns across all applicable jurisdictions.

## Overview

Preparing and filing corporate income tax returns across all applicable federal, state, and local jurisdictions. This process involves gathering trial balance data and supporting workpapers, computing taxable income through book-to-tax adjustments, and completing the required return forms. Returns undergo multi-level review before obtaining authorized officer sign-off, are filed electronically with the taxing authority, and are tracked through acceptance confirmation.
