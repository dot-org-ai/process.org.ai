# Calculate deferred taxes

> Business-as-Code definition for deferred tax calculation. Models the computation of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between book and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

## Overview

Calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. This process identifies all timing differences such as depreciation, stock compensation, lease obligations, and reserves, then applies current and future enacted tax rates to compute deferred balances. It also includes the assessment of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, roll-forward reconciliations, and the preparation of ASC 740 footnote disclosures for financial reporting.

// Compute the deferred tax schedule for an entity
const schedule = await client.getDeferredTaxSchedule({
  entity: 'US-PARENT',
  period: '2025-12',
  includeValuationAllowance: true
})

// Get the temporary difference breakdown
const tempDiffs = await client.getTemporaryDifferenceDetail({
  entity: 'CONSOLIDATED',
  period: '2025-12',
  categories: ['depreciation', 'stockCompensation', 'leases', 'reserves']
})
