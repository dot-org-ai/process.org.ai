# Address tax inquiries

> Business-as-Code definition for tax inquiry response. Models the management of tax authority audits, information requests, notices, and disputes including document production and negotiation.

## Overview

Addressing tax queries, audits, and notices from regulatory and government authorities by assembling documentation, drafting responses, and negotiating proposed adjustments. This process covers the full lifecycle from initial notice triage through document production, audit fieldwork coordination, and appeal evaluation. It also includes the accrual of contingent liabilities for probable tax assessments under ASC 450/FIN 48 and the archival of all correspondence and workpapers for future reference.
