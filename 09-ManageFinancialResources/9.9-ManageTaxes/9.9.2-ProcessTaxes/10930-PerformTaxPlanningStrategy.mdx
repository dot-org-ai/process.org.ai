# Perform tax planning/strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for periodic tax planning execution. Models the implementation of tax strategies for the current period including estimated payments, provision calculations, and timing optimization.

## Overview

Creating and implementing strategies for taxes to be paid or collected by the business. This process translates the approved tax plan into periodic execution activities, including the calculation of estimated tax payments, computation of tax provisions for financial reporting, and optimization of deduction timing. It also encompasses transfer pricing compliance reviews and the documentation of uncertain tax positions to manage risk and ensure accurate financial statement disclosures.
