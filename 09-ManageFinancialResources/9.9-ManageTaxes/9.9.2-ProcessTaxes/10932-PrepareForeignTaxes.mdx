# Prepare foreign taxes

> Business-as-Code definition for foreign tax preparation. Models the calculation and documentation of tax obligations for international jurisdictions including foreign tax credits and treaty benefits.

## Overview

Preparing and filing tax obligations for international jurisdictions where the organization has foreign subsidiaries or taxable presence. This process includes gathering financial data from foreign entities, computing taxable income per local country rules, determining creditable foreign taxes for the domestic return, and evaluating tax treaty provisions. It also covers OECD Country-by-Country reporting for transfer pricing transparency and the reconciliation of intercompany transactions.
