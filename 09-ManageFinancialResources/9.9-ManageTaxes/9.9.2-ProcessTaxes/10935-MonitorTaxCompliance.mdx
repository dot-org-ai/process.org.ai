# Monitor tax compliance

> Business-as-Code definition for tax compliance monitoring. Models the tracking of filing deadlines, payment obligations, and regulatory changes to ensure timely and accurate tax compliance across all jurisdictions.

## Overview

Tracking filing deadlines, payment obligations, and regulatory changes across all jurisdictions to ensure the organization remains in full tax compliance. This process maintains a comprehensive filing calendar, monitors legislative updates that may affect obligations, and audits the completeness of all required returns and information reports. When compliance gaps are detected, the team assesses potential penalty exposure and escalates risks to leadership for timely remediation.
