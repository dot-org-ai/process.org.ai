# Perform variance analysis against forecasts and budgets

> Business-as-Code definition for variance analysis against forecasts and budgets. Models the comparison of actual financial results to budgeted and forecasted amounts, identification of material deviations, and root cause investigation.

## Overview

Conducting a quantitative analysis between what was forecasted and budgeted and actual financial behavior. This process compares actual revenues, expenses, and cash flows against both the approved budget and the latest forecast, decomposing deviations into volume, rate, and mix components. Material variances are investigated for root cause and escalated to management with explanatory commentary. Rigorous variance analysis is the primary feedback loop in the planning cycle, enabling organizations to hold cost center owners accountable, recalibrate forecasts, and adjust operational plans before small deviations compound into significant financial misses.
