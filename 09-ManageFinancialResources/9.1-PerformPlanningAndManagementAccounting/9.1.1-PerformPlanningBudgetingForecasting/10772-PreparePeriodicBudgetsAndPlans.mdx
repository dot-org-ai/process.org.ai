# Prepare periodic budgets and plans

> Business-as-Code definition for periodic budget and plan preparation. Models the compilation of department inputs, consolidation of operating budgets, and submission for executive approval.

## Overview

Creating reports on a quarterly or annual basis for fund allocation. Create a financial statement that estimates revenues and expenses over a specific period of time, leveraging budget methods such as cost-based and zero-based budgeting techniques in light of the periodic targets outlined during Develop and maintain budget policies and procedures [10771]. The budget preparation process drives organizational alignment by translating strategic objectives into departmental spending authorities and revenue targets. Effective budget preparation reduces over- and under-spending, supports capital allocation decisions, and establishes the baseline against which financial performance is measured throughout the fiscal period.
