# Develop and maintain budget policies and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for budget policy development and maintenance. Models the creation, review, and publication of budgetary guidelines, timelines, templates, and approval workflows.

## Overview

Formulating financial budgetary guidelines and strategies. Develop a framework for rules and regulations regarding budgets, including approval thresholds, timeline requirements, and template standards that govern the annual planning cycle. Well-defined budget policies reduce cycle time, ensure cross-departmental consistency, and provide the control framework that auditors and regulators expect. This process creates the step-by-step procedures cost center owners follow to request, justify, and gain authorization for resource allocations.
