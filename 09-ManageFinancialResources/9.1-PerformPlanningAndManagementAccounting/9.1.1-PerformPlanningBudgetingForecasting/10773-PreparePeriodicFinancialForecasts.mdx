# Prepare periodic financial forecasts

> Business-as-Code definition for periodic financial forecast preparation. Models the development of revenue, expense, and cash flow projections using trend analysis, driver-based modeling, and scenario planning.

## Overview

Creating estimates of the projected income and expenses required over a predetermined time frame. Develop the projections of profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and the cash flow forecast using driver-based models, trend analysis, and scenario planning. Accurate financial forecasting enables leadership to anticipate cash shortfalls, reallocate resources proactively, and adjust strategy before variances become material. Rolling forecasts, updated monthly or quarterly, provide a more agile alternative to static annual budgets and improve organizational responsiveness to changing market conditions.

const forecasting = preparePeriodicFinancialForecasts()

// Build a rolling 12-month forecast
const forecast = await forecasting.buildForecastModel({
  horizon: 12,
  method: 'driver-based',
  drivers: ['headcount', 'revenue-pipeline', 'unit-volume']
})

// Run scenario comparison
const scenarios = await forecasting.runScenarios({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  scenarios: ['optimistic', 'base', 'conservative']
})
```
