# Determine critical activities

> Business-as-Code definition for critical activity determination. Models the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of essential business activities to protect value-generating processes from cost reduction.

## Overview

Determine the activities that hinder the progress of finance activities. This requires the organization to determine those business activities carried out by the financial function of the organization and which are indispensable. This undertaking helps the organization triangulate those activities which are essential and where costs cannot be slashed.
