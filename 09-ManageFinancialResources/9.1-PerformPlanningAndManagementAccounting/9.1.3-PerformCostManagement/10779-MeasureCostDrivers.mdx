# Measure cost drivers

> Business-as-Code definition for cost driver measurement. Models the quantification, tracking, and reporting of cost driver volumes and rates to support activity-based costing and allocation decisions.

## Overview

Calculating cost driver volumes and per-unit rates for each measurement period. This process collects transaction counts, machine hours, labor hours, and other driver quantities from operational systems, then computes the cost per unit of each driver based on actual spending. Period-over-period trending reveals whether cost driver rates are stable, improving, or deteriorating, providing early signals for cost management intervention. Accurate driver measurement is the quantitative backbone of activity-based costing and supports reliable overhead allocation, product costing, and capacity planning.

  costPool: 'Manufacturing Overhead'
})

// Get driver volume trends
const trends = await measurement.getDriverRateTrends({
  driver: 'machine-hours',
  periods: 12,
  granularity: 'monthly'
})
