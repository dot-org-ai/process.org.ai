# Perform cost management

> Business-as-Code definition for cost management operations. Models cost driver identification, measurement, activity-based analysis, and asset resource optimization as programmable APIs.

## Overview

Deciding which expenses can be avoided to reduce some costs and increase revenues. Plan and control the organization's budget to forecast future expenditures.

## Usage

```typescript
import { performCostManagement } from '@headlessly/perform-cost-management'

const costMgmt = performCostManagement()

// Identify top cost drivers for a business unit
const drivers = await costMgmt.identifyCostDrivers({
  businessUnit: 'BU-Manufacturing',
  period: '2025',
  topN: 10
})

// Get resource utilization report
const utilization = await costMgmt.getResourceUtilization({
  assetCategory: 'production-equipment',
  location: 'Plant-A'
})
```
