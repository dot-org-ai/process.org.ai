# Manage asset resource deployment and utilization

> Business-as-Code definition for asset resource deployment management. Models the allocation, tracking, and optimization of organizational assets across business processes to maximize utilization and return on investment.

## Overview

Distributing or allocating asset resources in different processes for optimal utilization. This process evaluates available capacity across equipment, facilities, technology, and human resources, then assigns those assets to business processes based on strategic priority and expected return. Continuous tracking of actual utilization against planned deployment reveals idle capacity and bottlenecks, enabling rebalancing before inefficiencies erode margins. Effective asset deployment management maximizes return on assets, reduces unnecessary capital expenditure, and ensures that critical business activities have the resources they need to meet performance targets.

const resources = manageAssetResourceDeploymentAndUtilization()

// Track utilization for the period
const utilization = await resources.getResourceUtilization({
  assetType: 'equipment',
  department: 'Manufacturing',
  period: 'Q4-2025'
})

// Find underutilized assets for redeployment
const underutilized = await resources.getUnderutilizedAssets({
  threshold: 0.60,
  assetCategory: 'machinery'
})
```
