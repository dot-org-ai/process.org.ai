# Determine key cost drivers

> Business-as-Code definition for cost driver identification. Models the analysis and classification of factors that cause costs to increase or decrease across business activities and processes.

## Overview

Defining cost drivers for a particular activity. Cost drivers are the measurable factors -- such as transaction volume, machine hours, headcount, or order complexity -- that cause costs to increase or decrease as activity levels change. This process maps activities to their associated cost pools, classifies drivers by type, and validates statistical correlation between driver volumes and actual cost behavior. Identifying the right cost drivers is foundational to activity-based costing, enabling accurate product costing, meaningful overhead allocation, and targeted cost reduction efforts that address root causes rather than symptoms.

const drivers = determineKeyCostDrivers()

// Identify cost drivers for a department
const departmentDrivers = await drivers.identifyActivityCosts({
  department: 'Manufacturing',
  period: 'Q4-2025'
})

// Rank drivers by impact
const ranked = await drivers.getDriverImpactRanking({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  threshold: 0.05
})
```
