# Assess customer and product profitability

> Business-as-Code definition for customer and product profitability assessment. Models the analysis of revenue, cost-to-serve, and margin contribution by customer segment and product line.

## Overview

Studying product demand and targeted customer preferences. Study customers' demands or preferences after deducting the full cost of delivering the final product, including cost-to-serve components such as sales support, logistics, returns, and post-sale service. This process calculates contribution margins at the individual customer and product level, ranks segments from most to least profitable, and flags those operating below breakeven thresholds. The resulting insights drive strategic decisions around pricing adjustments, customer tiering, product rationalization, and targeted investment in high-margin growth opportunities.
