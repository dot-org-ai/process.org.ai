# Optimize customer and product mix

> Business-as-Code definition for customer and product mix optimization. Models the analysis of portfolio composition, margin contribution, and resource constraints to maximize overall profitability through strategic mix adjustments.

## Overview

Creating the best fit between a product and the end user. Maximize the customer base by providing different products in the market, while shifting portfolio emphasis toward higher-margin segments. This process analyzes the current composition of revenue by customer segment and product line, models what-if scenarios that adjust emphasis levels, and maps capacity and supply chain constraints that bound feasible mix changes. Effective mix optimization improves weighted-average contribution margins without requiring cost reductions, making it one of the highest-leverage activities in financial performance management.

const mix = optimizeCustomerAndProductMix()

// Analyze current portfolio composition
const current = await mix.analyzeCurrentMix({
  period: 'Q4-2025',
  dimensions: ['product-line', 'customer-segment']
})

// Model a what-if scenario
const scenario = await mix.modelMixScenarios({
  adjustments: [
    { segment: 'Enterprise', emphasis: 1.2 },
    { segment: 'SMB', emphasis: 0.8 }
  ],
  period: '2026'
