# Prepare activity-based performance measures

> Business-as-Code definition for activity-based performance measurement. Models the design, calculation, and reporting of performance metrics tied to specific business activities using activity-based costing principles.

## Overview

Evaluating performance based on different sets of activities created by management to measure performance. This process uses activity-based costing principles to compute cost per unit of output for each business activity, then benchmarks those results against internal targets and external peer data. Activity-based performance measures reveal process-level efficiency and highlight where operational improvements would yield the greatest cost savings. The resulting scorecards enable management to make data-driven resource allocation decisions, prioritize continuous improvement initiatives, and hold process owners accountable for activity-level cost and quality outcomes.

  department: 'Order Processing',
  period: 'Q4-2025'
})

// Get activities flagged for improvement
const targets = await abcMetrics.getImprovementTargets({
  thresholdPct: 0.90,
  period: '2025'
})
