# Perform life cycle costing

> Business-as-Code definition for life cycle costing. Models the estimation and tracking of total cost of ownership across all product phases from development through disposal, supporting strategic pricing and investment decisions.

## Overview

Determining the cost of delivering an end product at different stages of production. Study the total life cycle of a product/process to determine how much revenue and production cost will be incurred at every stage in order to make strategic decisions.

const lifecycle = performLifeCycleCosting()

// Compute total cost of ownership for a product
const tco = await lifecycle.computeTotalCostOfOwnership({
  productId: 'PRD-8200',
  lifespanYears: 10,
  productionVolume: 50000
})

// Compare life cycle costs across product alternatives
const comparison = await lifecycle.getLifeCycleComparisons({
  productIds: ['PRD-8200', 'PRD-8201', 'PRD-8202']
})
```
