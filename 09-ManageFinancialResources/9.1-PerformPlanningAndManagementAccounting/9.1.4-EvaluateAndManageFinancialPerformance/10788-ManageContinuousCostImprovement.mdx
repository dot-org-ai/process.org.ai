# Manage continuous cost improvement

> Business-as-Code definition for continuous cost improvement management. Models the identification, prioritization, execution, and tracking of cost reduction initiatives across the organization using kaizen and lean principles.

## Overview

Conducting activities to improve cost distribution regularly. Follow or adopt different ways of reducing costs using kaizen, lean, and six sigma methodologies to drive systematic waste elimination and process efficiency gains. This process identifies cost reduction opportunities by analyzing spending patterns, benchmarking against peers, and leveraging insights from activity-based performance measures. Approved initiatives are prioritized by projected savings and implementation effort, executed with defined milestones, and tracked against savings targets to ensure realized benefits match projections. A well-managed continuous improvement program compounds year-over-year savings that significantly improve long-term operating margins.
