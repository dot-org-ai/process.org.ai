# Track performance of new-customer and product strategies

> Business-as-Code definition for tracking new customer and product strategy performance. Models the measurement, monitoring, and reporting of financial outcomes from newly launched customer acquisition and product introduction strategies.

## Overview

Observing the behavior of a new set of customers for different products. Prepare strategies to improve sales and profits by measuring actual financial outcomes from recently launched customer acquisition and product introduction initiatives against original business case projections. This process defines KPIs, collects revenue and cost data specific to each strategy, and identifies strategies that are significantly over- or under-performing expectations. Timely tracking enables course correction before sunk costs accumulate, ensures accountability for investment decisions, and feeds lessons learned back into the product evaluation and portfolio optimization processes.
