# Evaluate new products

> Business-as-Code definition for new product financial evaluation. Models the financial feasibility analysis of proposed products including market sizing, cost estimation, NPV calculation, and go/no-go investment decisions.

## Overview

Checking demand about a specific product by a customer segment. Conduct a detailed study or research of customer behavior and preferences for a product in order to determine its production feasibility and profitability in a specific market. This process builds financial models that project addressable market size, estimate development and production costs, compute net present value and internal rate of return, and assess market and technical risk factors. The resulting go/no-go recommendation enables the investment committee to allocate capital to products with the strongest risk-adjusted return potential while avoiding commitments that would dilute overall portfolio profitability.
