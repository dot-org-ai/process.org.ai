# Perform product costing

> Business-as-Code definition for product costing. Models the calculation of per-unit product costs including direct materials, direct labor, and allocated manufacturing overhead using standard or actual costing methods.

## Overview

Studying and finding out the relevant cost center for a product by studying every resource used in its making. Product costing calculates the per-unit cost of manufactured goods by aggregating direct materials from the bill of materials, direct labor from production routings, and allocated manufacturing overhead using activity-based or volume-based cost drivers. Standard costs established through this process serve as the pricing floor, the baseline for variance analysis, and the inventory valuation basis for financial statements. Maintaining accurate product costs is critical for profitable pricing decisions, make-versus-buy analysis, and identifying cost reduction opportunities in the production process.

const costing = performProductCosting()

// Calculate standard cost for a product
const cost = await costing.setStandardCost({

  components: {
    materials: 42.50,
    labor: 18.75,
    overhead: 22.00
  }
})

// Get cost sheet for a product
const sheet = await costing.getProductCostSheet({
  productId: 'PRD-8200'
})
```
