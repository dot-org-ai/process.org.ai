# Perform profit center accounting

> Business-as-Code definition for profit center accounting. Models the tracking of revenues, costs, and profit margins by business unit or profit center for internal management reporting.

## Overview

Determining the revenue, profits, and losses incurred by each unit within the organization that produces profit. Profit center accounting assigns revenues and allocates direct and shared costs to discrete business units, product lines, or geographic regions, producing internal income statements that reveal where the organization creates and destroys value. This process requires well-defined allocation rules for shared services, corporate overhead, and transfer pricing between segments. Accurate profit center results empower business unit leaders to manage their P&L, support investment decisions between segments, and provide the foundation for management incentive compensation.
