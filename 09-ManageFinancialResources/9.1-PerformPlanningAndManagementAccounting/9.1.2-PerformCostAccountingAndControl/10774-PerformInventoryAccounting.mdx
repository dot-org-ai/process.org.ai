# Perform inventory accounting

> Business-as-Code definition for inventory accounting. Models inventory valuation, cost method application, obsolescence reserves, and inventory-to-GL reconciliation.

## Overview

Conducting accounting for assets, and finding reasons for changes such as depreciation, obsolescence, deterioration, changes in customer taste, increased demand, and decreased market supply. Inventory accounting applies valuation methods such as FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average to assign monetary values to on-hand stock, ensuring the balance sheet accurately reflects asset worth. The process also manages obsolescence reserves, reconciles physical counts to system records, and posts inventory transactions to the general ledger. Accurate inventory accounting directly impacts cost of goods sold, gross margin reporting, and tax obligations, making it essential for reliable financial statements and regulatory compliance.

const inventory = performInventoryAccounting()

// Value inventory using weighted average
const valuation = await inventory.valueInventory({

  asOfDate: '2025-12-31',
  location: 'Warehouse-A'
})

// Assess obsolescence reserves
const reserve = await inventory.assessObsolescence({
  ageThreshold: 180,
  writeDownPercentage: 0.50
})
```
