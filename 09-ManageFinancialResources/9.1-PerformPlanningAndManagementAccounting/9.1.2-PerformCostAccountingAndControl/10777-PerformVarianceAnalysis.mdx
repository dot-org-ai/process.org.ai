# Perform variance analysis

> Business-as-Code definition for cost variance analysis. Models the comparison of actual costs to standard or budgeted costs, decomposing deviations into material, labor, and overhead variances.

## Overview

Discovering the changes between forecasted and actual costing. Analyze actual and planned behavior by reviewing the amount of a variance on a trend line in order to maintain control over a business. This process decomposes cost deviations into material price and usage variances, labor rate and efficiency variances, and overhead spending and volume variances, providing granular visibility into where and why costs diverge from standards. Manufacturing and procurement leaders use these insights to negotiate better supplier contracts, improve production efficiency, and adjust standard costs. Timely variance analysis is essential for cost control, continuous improvement, and accurate product profitability assessment.
