# Perform cost of sales analysis

> Business-as-Code definition for cost of sales analysis. Models the breakdown, tracking, and reporting of direct costs associated with producing goods sold, including materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead.

## Overview

Studying expenses directly associated with products sold during a period. Analyze the cost of sales, which encompasses raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead consumed in producing goods that generated revenue. This process breaks down COGS by cost element, product line, and channel to reveal margin drivers and identify cost escalation trends. Effective cost of sales analysis enables pricing adjustments, informs make-versus-buy decisions, and provides the gross margin visibility that leadership requires for strategic resource allocation.
