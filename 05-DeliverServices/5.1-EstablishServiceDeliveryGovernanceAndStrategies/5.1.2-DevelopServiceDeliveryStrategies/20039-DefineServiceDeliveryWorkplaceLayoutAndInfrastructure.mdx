const requirements = await workplace.assessWorkplaceRequirements({
  location: 'headquarters',
  headcount: 200,
  serviceTypes: ['consulting', 'managed-services'],
  includeRemoteWork: true
})

// Design workplace layout
const layout = await workplace.designWorkplaceLayout({
  requirementsId: requirements.id,
  zones: ['collaboration', 'focused-work', 'client-meeting', 'training'],
  capacityTarget: 250
