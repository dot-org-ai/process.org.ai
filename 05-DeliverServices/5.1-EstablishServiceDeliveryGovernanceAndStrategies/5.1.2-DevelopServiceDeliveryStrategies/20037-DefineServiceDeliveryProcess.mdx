# Define service delivery process

> Business-as-Code definition for designing and documenting the end-to-end processes, procedures, and workflows that govern how services are delivered to customers.

## Overview

Defanging policies and procedures that focus on meeting the needs and expectations of the customer within the working parameters of the organization.

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: Service Delivery Process
  actor: ProcessDesigner
  result: ProcessDefinition
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| mapCurrentProcesses | Document existing service delivery workflows and handoffs |
| identifyProcessGaps | Analyze current processes against best practices to find improvement opportunities |
| designTargetProcess | Create optimized service delivery process flows and procedures |
| defineProcessControls | Establish quality gates, checkpoints, and escalation paths |
| documentProcessStandards | Formalize process documentation with roles, steps, and templates |
| publishProcessDefinitions | Release approved process definitions to all delivery teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| currentProcessesMapped | Existing process documentation completed |
| processGapsIdentified | Gap analysis between current and target state finalized |
| targetProcessDesigned | Optimized service delivery process approved |
| processControlsDefined | Quality gates and escalation procedures established |
| processStandardsDocumented | Process documentation formalized and reviewed |
| processDefinitionsPublished | Process definitions released to delivery organization |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findProcessDefinitions | Retrieve process definitions filtered by service type, version, or status |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineServiceDeliveryProcess } from '@headlessly/define-service-delivery-process'

const process = defineServiceDeliveryProcess()

// Map current delivery processes
const currentState = await process.mapCurrentProcesses({
  serviceType: 'implementation',
  includeHandoffs: true,
  includeTimings: true
})

// Design target process with improvements
const targetProcess = await process.designTargetProcess({
  currentStateId: currentState.id,
  optimizationGoals: ['reduce-cycle-time', 'improve-quality', 'standardize-handoffs'],
  referenceFramework: 'ITIL'
})

// Publish process definitions
await process.publishProcessDefinitions({
  processId: targetProcess.id,
  effectiveDate: '2026-02-01',
  notifyTeams: ['consulting', 'implementation', 'support']
})
```
