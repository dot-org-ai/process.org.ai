## Usage

```typescript
import { evaluateResourceAvailability } from '@headlessly/evaluate-resource-availability'

const resources = evaluateResourceAvailability()

// Inventory current resources across service lines
const inventory = await resources.inventoryCurrentResources({
  serviceLines: ['consulting', 'managed-services'],
  includeContractors: true,
  asOfDate: '2026-01-01'
})

// Assess skill gaps against upcoming demand
const gaps = await resources.assessSkillGaps({
  inventoryId: inventory.id,
  demandPeriod: '2026-Q1',
  criticalSkills: ['cloud-architecture', 'data-engineering', 'project-management']
})

// Recommend resourcing actions to close gaps
const recommendations = await resources.recommendResourcingActions({
  gapAnalysisId: gaps.id,
  budgetConstraint: 500000,
  preferredMethods: ['training', 'hiring', 'subcontracting']
})
