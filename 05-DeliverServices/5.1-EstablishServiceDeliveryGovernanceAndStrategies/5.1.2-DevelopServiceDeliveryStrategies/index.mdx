# Develop service delivery strategies

> Business-as-Code definition for service delivery strategy development. Models goal definition, labor policy creation, resource evaluation, network constraint analysis, process design, procedure validation, and workplace infrastructure planning as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Constructing strategies that identify goals, policies, processes, and procedures in relation to service delivery. Review and validate strategies. Define the workplace layout and infrastructure.
