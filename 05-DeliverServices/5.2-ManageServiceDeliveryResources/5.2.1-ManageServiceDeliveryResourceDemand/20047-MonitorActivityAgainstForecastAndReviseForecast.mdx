# Monitor activity against forecast and revise forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for continuously comparing actual service delivery activity against forecast projections and making real-time adjustments to maintain forecast relevance.

## Overview

Overseeing all activities necessary to deliver services to customer. Revise forecast to account for any issues that may arise. This could be changes in market trend, resource changes, etc.

// Compare actuals to forecast
const variance = await monitoring.compareActualsToForecast({
  forecastId: 'consensus-2026-Q1',
  actualPeriod: '2026-01',
  varianceThreshold: 0.1
})

// Identify variance drivers
const drivers = await monitoring.identifyVarianceDrivers({
  varianceReportId: variance.id,
  categories: ['market-shift', 'resource-change', 'client-delay']
})

// Revise forecast projections
const revised = await monitoring.reviseForecastProjections({
