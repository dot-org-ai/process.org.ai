# Measure forecast accuracy

> Business-as-Code definition for quantifying the precision of demand forecasts by comparing predictions against actual outcomes and computing statistical accuracy metrics.

## Overview

Analyzing forecasting against actuals to determine accuracy. Modify forecasting to align with actual need.

const accuracy = measureForecastAccuracy()

// Collect forecast-actual pairs for measurement
const pairs = await accuracy.collectForecastActualPairs({
  forecastId: 'consensus-2025-Q4',
  actualPeriod: '2025-Q4',
  granularity: 'monthly'
})

// Calculate accuracy metrics
const metrics = await accuracy.calculateAccuracyMetrics({
  dataSetId: pairs.id,
  measures: ['MAPE', 'RMSE', 'bias', 'tracking-signal']
})

// Analyze accuracy by segment
const segmented = await accuracy.analyzeAccuracyBySegment({
  metricsId: metrics.id,
  segments: ['service-line', 'region', 'client-tier']
})
```
