# Manage service delivery resource demand

> Business-as-Code definition for service delivery resource demand management. Models pipeline monitoring, baseline forecasting, customer collaboration, consensus forecasting, skills assessment, forecast revision, and accuracy measurement as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Ensuring necessary resources are maintained through monitoring pipeline, developing forecasts, and collaborating with customers. Determine skills needed for service deliver and forecast customer orders. Monitor forecasted orders and modify if where needed. Measure forecast accuracy.
