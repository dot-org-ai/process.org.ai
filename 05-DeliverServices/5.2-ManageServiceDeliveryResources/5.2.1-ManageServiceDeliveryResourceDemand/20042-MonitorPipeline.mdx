# Monitor pipeline

> Business-as-Code definition for tracking and analyzing the service delivery opportunity pipeline to anticipate resource demand and ensure delivery readiness.

## Overview

Tracking potential opportunities as they move through the various stages of the pipeline.

## Usage

```typescript
import { monitorPipeline } from '@headlessly/monitor-pipeline'

const pipeline = monitorPipeline()

// Review current pipeline stages
const stages = await pipeline.reviewPipelineStages({
  serviceLines: ['consulting', 'implementation'],
  minDealValue: 50000,
  stages: ['qualified', 'proposal', 'negotiation']
})

// Estimate resource impact of pipeline
const impact = await pipeline.estimateResourceImpact({
  pipelineId: stages.id,
  horizonMonths: 6,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.7
})

// Flag high priority deals for resource reservation
const flagged = await pipeline.flagHighPriorityDeals({
  criteria: { startWithin: '30-days', minimumValue: 200000 }
})
```
