# Develop baseline forecasts

> Business-as-Code definition for creating initial demand forecasts using historical data, market analysis, and statistical models to project future service delivery resource needs.

## Overview

Identifying the demand anticipated for the organization's services. Estimate future demand for services using historical data, analysis of the market environment, and external data.

const forecasting = developBaselineForecasts()

// Gather historical data for forecast modeling
const historicalData = await forecasting.gatherHistoricalData({
  serviceLines: ['consulting', 'managed-services'],
  lookbackMonths: 24,
  granularity: 'monthly'
})

// Build and generate baseline forecast
const forecast = await forecasting.generateBaselineForecast({
  dataSetId: historicalData.id,
  forecastHorizon: '12-months',
  methodology: 'time-series-decomposition'
})

// Publish baseline forecast
await forecasting.publishBaselineForecast({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  audience: ['resource-management', 'finance', 'operations']
})
