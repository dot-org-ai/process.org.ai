## Usage

```typescript
import { createResourcePlan } from '@headlessly/create-resource-plan'

const planning = createResourcePlan()

// Aggregate demand requirements
const demand = await planning.aggregateDemandRequirements({
  forecastId: 'consensus-2026-Q1',
  confirmedOrders: true,
  tentativeOrders: true
})

// Model capacity scenarios
const scenarios = await planning.modelCapacityScenarios({
  demandId: demand.id,
  strategies: ['optimize-utilization', 'buffer-capacity', 'hybrid'],
  includeContractorPool: true
})

// Approve and communicate the resource plan
await planning.approveResourcePlan({
  scenarioId: scenarios.recommended.id,
  approver: 'vp-operations',
  effectivePeriod: '2026-Q1'
})
```
