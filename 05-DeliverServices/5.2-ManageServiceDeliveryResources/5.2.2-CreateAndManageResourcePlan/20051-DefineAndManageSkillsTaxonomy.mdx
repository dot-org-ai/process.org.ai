  serviceLines: ['consulting', 'implementation', 'managed-services'],
  includeEmergingTech: true
})

// Define skill levels
const levels = await taxonomy.defineSkillLevels({
  taxonomyId: domains.id,
  proficiencyScale: ['foundational', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'expert'],
  assessmentCriteria: true
})

// Map skills to delivery roles
await taxonomy.mapSkillsToRoles({
  taxonomyId: domains.id,
  roles: ['solution-architect', 'project-manager', 'technical-consultant']
})
