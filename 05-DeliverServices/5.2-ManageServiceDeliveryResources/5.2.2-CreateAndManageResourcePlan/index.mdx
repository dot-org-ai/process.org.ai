# Create and manage resource plan

> Business-as-Code definition for resource plan creation and management. Models skills taxonomy, resource planning, demand-capacity matching, supplier collaboration, critical resource identification, and capacity monitoring as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Identifying the need for and creating a resource plan. Understand resource demand and align with capacity, skills, and capabilities. Enlist suppliers and partners to supplement needed skills and capabilities. Monitor and manage capabilities and skills with an eye on critical resources and supplier capacity.
