  engagementId: 'eng-789',
  methods: ['structured-interviews', 'retrospective-notes', 'survey'],
  participants: ['delivery-team', 'project-manager', 'technical-lead']
})

// Codify reusable assets
const assets = await knowledge.codifyReusableAssets({
  engagementId: 'eng-789',
  assetTypes: ['solution-template', 'estimation-model', 'testing-framework'],
  generalizationLevel: 'industry-agnostic'
})

// Publish to knowledge base
await knowledge.publishToKnowledgeBase({
