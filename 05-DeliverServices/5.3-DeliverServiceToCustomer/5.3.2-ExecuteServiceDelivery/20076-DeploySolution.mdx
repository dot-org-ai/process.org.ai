const deployment = deploySolution()

// Create deployment plan
const plan = await deployment.createDeploymentPlan({
  engagementId: 'eng-789',
  solutionId: 'sol-456',
  targetDate: '2026-05-15',
  strategy: 'blue-green',
  rollbackProcedure: 'automated'
})

// Execute deployment cutover
const cutover = await deployment.executeDeploymentCutover({
  planId: plan.id,
  approvedBy: 'deployment-manager',
  notifyStakeholders: true
})

// Confirm deployment success
await deployment.confirmDeploymentSuccess({
  cutoverId: cutover.id,
