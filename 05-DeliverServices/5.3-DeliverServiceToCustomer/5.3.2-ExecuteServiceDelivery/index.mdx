# Execute service delivery

> Business-as-Code definition for service delivery execution. Models environment analysis, solution definition, validation, change identification, approval workflows, build-or-buy decisions, and solution deployment as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Carrying out service delivery to the customer by creating and deploying the necessary solution. Analyze need and create a solution. Validate the solution and make changes if needed. Obtain approval to build/buy solution and then deploy solution to customer.

  scope: ['infrastructure', 'integrations', 'data-landscape'],
  assessmentDepth: 'detailed'
})

// Deploy solution
const deployment = await client.deploySolution({
  engagementId: 'ENG-2025-0567',
