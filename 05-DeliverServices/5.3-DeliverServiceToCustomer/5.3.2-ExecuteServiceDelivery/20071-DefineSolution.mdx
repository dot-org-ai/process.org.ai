# Define solution

> Business-as-Code definition for designing and specifying the service delivery solution that addresses identified customer needs, including architecture, components, integration points, and implementation approach.

## Overview

Creating a plan of action to provide service delivery to the customer through a possible solution. This solution should be in response to a collaborative effort made by the organization and the customer to meet service delivery needs.

  pattern: 'microservices',
  targetEnvironment: 'hybrid-cloud'
})

// Specify technical requirements
const specs = await solution.specifyTechnicalRequirements({
  architectureId: architecture.id,
  categories: ['performance', 'security', 'scalability', 'availability']
})

// Document complete solution specification
await solution.documentSolutionSpecification({
  architectureId: architecture.id,
