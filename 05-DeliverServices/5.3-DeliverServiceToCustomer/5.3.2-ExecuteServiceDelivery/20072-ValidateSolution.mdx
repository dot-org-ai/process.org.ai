# Validate solution

> Business-as-Code definition for verifying that the proposed service delivery solution meets all customer requirements, technical standards, and business constraints before proceeding with implementation.

## Overview

Validating that the proposed solution is feasible and provides the needed services for the customer.

const validation = validateSolution()

// Review solution against requirements
const traceability = await validation.reviewSolutionAgainstRequirements({
  solutionId: 'sol-456',
  requirementsBaseline: 'needs-assessment-v2',
  coverageThreshold: 0.95
})

// Conduct risk assessment
const risks = await validation.conductRiskAssessment({
  solutionId: 'sol-456',
  riskCategories: ['technical', 'operational', 'financial', 'schedule'],
  mitigationRequired: true
})

// Document validation findings
await validation.documentValidationFindings({
