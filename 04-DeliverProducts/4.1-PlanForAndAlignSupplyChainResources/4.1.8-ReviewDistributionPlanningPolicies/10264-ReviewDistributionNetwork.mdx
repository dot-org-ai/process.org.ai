# Review distribution network

> Business-as-Code definition for distribution network review. Models network performance evaluation, lane analysis, and network optimization recommendations as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Evaluating the system that defines how the products/inventory would reach from the source (i.e., manufacturer) to the destination (i.e., retailer/distributer).

## Process Hierarchy

    A --> B[Evaluate distribution network against cost]
    A --> C[Review transportation lanes for cost-effectiveness and ]
    A --> D[Assess warehouse and distribution center capacity usage]
    A --> E[Detect coverage gaps or redundancies in the distributio]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
review:
  object: Distribution Network
  actor: DistributionNetworkAnalyst
  result: NetworkReviewReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessNetworkPerformance | Evaluate distribution network against cost, service, and utilization KPIs |
| analyzeLaneEfficiency | Review transportation lanes for cost-effectiveness and transit time performance |
| evaluateNodeUtilization | Assess warehouse and distribution center capacity usage and throughput |
| identifyNetworkGaps | Detect coverage gaps or redundancies in the distribution footprint |
| recommendNetworkChanges | Propose network redesign or optimization opportunities |

## Events

## Usage

```typescript
import { reviewDistributionNetwork } from '@headlessly/review-distribution-network'

const client = reviewDistributionNetwork()

// Assess network performance
const performance = await client.assessNetworkPerformance({
  networkScope: 'north-america',
  period: 'Q2-2025',
  metrics: ['cost-per-unit', 'transit-time', 'utilization']
})

// Identify network gaps
const gaps = await client.identifyNetworkGaps({
  networkId: performance.networkId,
  coverageTarget: { maxTransitDays: 2, populationPercent: 95 }
})
```
