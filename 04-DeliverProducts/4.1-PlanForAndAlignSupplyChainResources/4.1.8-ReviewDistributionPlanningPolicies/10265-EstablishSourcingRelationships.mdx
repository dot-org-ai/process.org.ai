# Establish sourcing relationships

> Business-as-Code definition for sourcing relationship establishment. Models supplier network design, sourcing assignments, and supply-demand matching for distribution as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Establishing relationships with transportation/distribution sources in order to ensure an effective distribution network and strategy. Screen and evaluate various sources available to pick out the best among them.

## GraphDL

```yaml
establish:
  object: Sourcing Relationships
  actor: SourcingRelationshipManager
  result: SourcingRelationshipMap
```

const client = establishSourcingRelationships()

// Map supply sources to destinations
const assignments = await client.mapSupplyToDestinations({

  optimizationGoal: 'minimize-landed-cost',
  constraints: { maxLeadTimeDays: 5 }
})

// Establish primary and backup sources
const sources = await client.establishPrimaryBackupSources({
  destinationId: 'DC-southeast',
  productId: 'SKU-5500',
  backupRequired: true
})
```
