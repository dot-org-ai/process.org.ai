# Define standard operating procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for standard operating procedure creation. Models step-by-step work instructions, revision control, compliance mapping, and operator training linkage as programmable procedure documents.

## Overview

Establishing or prescribing methods to be followed routinely for the performance of designated operations or in designated situations. This may include step-by-step instructions to help workers carry out complex routine operations. The goal is to improve efficiency, quality, and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication, failure, or rework.
