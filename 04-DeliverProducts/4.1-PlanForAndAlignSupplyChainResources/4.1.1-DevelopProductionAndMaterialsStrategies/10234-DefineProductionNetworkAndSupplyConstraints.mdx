# Define production network and supply constraints

> Business-as-Code definition for production network and supply constraint mapping. Models supply chain topology, constraint identification, stakeholder relationships, and supply risk assessment as programmable network definitions.

## Overview

Defining limitations in the ability of the organization's supply chain to deliver a new stock, and creating a network of production stakeholders. Frame and manage relationships within the flow of manufacturing and processing operations. Identify probable supply issues.

    A --> C[Define capacities]
    A --> D[Define production process]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: Production Network And Supply Constraints
  actor: SupplyChainPlanner
  result: NetworkConstraintMap
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| mapProductionNetwork | Document the topology of production facilities and supply routes |
| identifySupplyConstraints | Catalog limitations in supply chain delivery capability |
| assessSupplyRisks | Evaluate probability and impact of supply disruptions |
| defineStakeholderRelationships | Establish roles and responsibilities across the production network |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| productionNetworkMapped | Network topology documented with all facilities and routes |
| supplyConstraintsIdentified | Supply chain limitations cataloged and prioritized |
| supplyRisksAssessed | Risk assessment completed for identified constraints |
| stakeholderRelationshipsDefined | Network partner roles and responsibilities documented |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getNetworkTopology | Retrieve production network map by region or product line |
| getConstraints | Query supply constraints by severity, type, or location |
| getSupplyRiskProfile | Retrieve supply risk assessment results |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineProductionNetworkAndSupplyConstraints } from '@headlessly/define-production-network-and-supply-constraints'

const client = defineProductionNetworkAndSupplyConstraints()

// Map production network
const network = await client.mapProductionNetwork({
  region: 'North America',
  includeSuppliers: true,
  includeDistributionCenters: true
})
```
