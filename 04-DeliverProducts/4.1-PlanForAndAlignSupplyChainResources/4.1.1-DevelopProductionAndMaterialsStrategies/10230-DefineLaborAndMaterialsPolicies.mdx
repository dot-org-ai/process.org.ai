# Define labor and materials policies

> Business-as-Code definition for labor and materials policy creation. Models workforce allocation rules, materials handling standards, and compliance requirements as programmable policy definitions.

## Overview

Setting up internal rules and regulations regarding the workforce and materials used in production operations. This includes defining labor scheduling policies, overtime guidelines, staffing ratios, and worker safety requirements, as well as establishing materials handling standards, storage protocols, quality acceptance criteria, and waste reduction targets. These policies ensure consistent, compliant, and cost-effective management of the two most significant production resources.
