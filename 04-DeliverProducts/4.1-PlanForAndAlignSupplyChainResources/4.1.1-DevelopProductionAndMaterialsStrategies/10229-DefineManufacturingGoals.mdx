# Define manufacturing goals

> Business-as-Code definition for manufacturing goal setting. Models the creation, alignment, and tracking of quantifiable production objectives tied to sales projections and organizational strategy.

## Overview

Creating quantifiable strategic objectives for each manufacturing segment in conjunction with sales projections. This involves setting specific output volume targets, throughput rates, yield improvement goals, and cost-per-unit objectives for every production line and facility. Manufacturing goals are developed collaboratively with sales, finance, and operations leadership to ensure alignment between market demand, financial feasibility, and production capacity.
