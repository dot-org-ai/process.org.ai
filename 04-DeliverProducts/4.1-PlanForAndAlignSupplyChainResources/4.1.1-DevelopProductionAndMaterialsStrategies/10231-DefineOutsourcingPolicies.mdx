# Define outsourcing policies

> Business-as-Code definition for outsourcing policy creation. Models make-versus-buy criteria, contract manufacturer governance, quality requirements, and risk management for outsourced production as programmable policies.

## Overview

Creating rules and regulations regarding contracting out of a business process to another party in order to reduce costs, access specialized capabilities, or increase production flexibility. This includes establishing make-versus-buy decision criteria, defining quality and compliance requirements for contract manufacturers, setting intellectual property protection standards, and specifying performance monitoring and governance expectations for outsourced operations.
