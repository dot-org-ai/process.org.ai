# Develop production and materials strategies

> Business-as-Code definition for production and materials strategy development. Models manufacturing goal setting, capacity planning, labor and outsourcing policies, and facility layout as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Creating strategies for production processes, as well as the process of managing materials. Define production and supply constraints. Design a blueprint of the workplace. Establish rules and regulations regarding the employees, outsourcing of services, and the expenditure to be incurred on the manufacturing capital.
