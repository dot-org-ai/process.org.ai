# Define capacities

> Business-as-Code definition for capacity planning and definition. Models the assessment of manufacturing throughput, equipment capability, workforce capacity, and resource optimization as programmable capacity profiles.

## Overview

Outlining the manufacturing and processing capacities of the organization. Delineate the capabilities required for optimizing output with available resources. Analyze capabilities possessed by the organization concerning the raw materials required and the process necessitated for producing finished products.

```typescript
import { defineCapacities } from '@headlessly/define-capacities'

const client = defineCapacities()

// Assess equipment capacity
const capacity = await client.assessEquipmentCapacity({
  facility: 'PLANT-WEST',
  productionLine: 'LINE-B2',
  measurementPeriod: '30-days',
  includeDowntime: true
})
