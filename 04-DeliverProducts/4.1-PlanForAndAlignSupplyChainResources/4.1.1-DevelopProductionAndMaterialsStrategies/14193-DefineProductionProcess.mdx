# Define production process

> Business-as-Code definition for production process design. Models workflow sequencing, bill-of-materials structuring, equipment assignment, and process validation as programmable process definitions.

## Overview

Outlining the scheme of processing inventory into finished products/services. This includes the use of raw materials, machinery, skill sets, and knowledge to create new offerings.

## Process Hierarchy

    A[Develop production and materials strategies] --> B[Define production process]
    A --> C[Define production network and supply constraints]
    A --> D[Define standard operating procedures]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: Production Process
  actor: ProcessEngineer
  result: ProductionProcessDefinition
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| designWorkflowSequence | Map the sequence of operations from raw materials to finished goods |
| defineBillOfMaterials | Specify materials, quantities, and assemblies for each product |
| assignEquipment | Allocate machinery and tooling to each production step |
| validateProcess | Test and confirm production process meets quality and throughput targets |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| workflowSequenceDesigned | Production workflow steps documented and sequenced |
| billOfMaterialsDefined | BOM structure created for product |
| equipmentAssigned | Machinery and tooling allocated to process steps |
| processValidated | Production process tested and confirmed operational |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProcessDefinition | Retrieve production process details by product or line |
| getBillOfMaterials | Query BOM structure for a specific product |
| getEquipmentAssignments | List equipment allocated to production process steps |

## Process Flow

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineProductionProcess } from '@headlessly/define-production-process'

const client = defineProductionProcess()

// Design workflow sequence
const workflow = await client.designWorkflowSequence({
  productId: 'PROD-7200',
  steps: ['raw-material-prep', 'machining', 'assembly', 'finishing', 'inspection'],
  targetCycleTime: 45
})
