# Define production workplace layout and infrastructure

> Business-as-Code definition for production workplace layout and infrastructure planning. Models floor plan design, equipment placement, utility provisioning, and ergonomic assessment as programmable facility configurations.

## Overview

Determining the floor plans for the processing facility that is meant for delivering finished products/services. Identify the totality of infrastructure needed for using this space in the manufacturing process, including machinery, factory floors, offices, and furniture.
