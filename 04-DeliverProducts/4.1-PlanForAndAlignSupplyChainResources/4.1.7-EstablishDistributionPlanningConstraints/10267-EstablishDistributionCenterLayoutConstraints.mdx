# Establish distribution center layout constraints

> Business-as-Code definition for distribution center layout constraints. Models facility space limitations, zone configurations, and throughput constraints as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Instituting the constraints for creating a layout for distribution center. Consider factors such as the number of customers, demand forecasting, product groups, condition of product conservation, warehousing, and transportation management.

## Process Hierarchy

    A[Establish distribution center layout constraints]
    A --> B[Establish maximum storage capacity for each warehouse z]
    A --> C[Define maximum receiving]
    A --> D[Specify dock door availability and loading bay limitati]
    A --> E[Document material flow path constraints and congestion ]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
establish:
  object: Distribution Center Layout Constraints
  actor: DistributionCenterPlanner
  result: LayoutConstraintSet
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineZoneCapacities | Establish maximum storage capacity for each warehouse zone |
| setThroughputLimits | Define maximum receiving, picking, and shipping throughput per shift |
| configureDockConstraints | Specify dock door availability and loading bay limitations |
| mapFlowPathRestrictions | Document material flow path constraints and congestion points |
| documentLayoutConstraints | Publish consolidated layout constraints for planning systems |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| zoneCapacitiesDefined | Maximum zone capacities established for the distribution center |
| throughputLimitsSet | Operational throughput limits defined per shift |
| dockConstraintsConfigured | Dock door and loading bay limitations documented |
| flowPathRestrictionsMapped | Material flow constraints and congestion points identified |
| layoutConstraintsDocumented | All layout constraints published for downstream planning |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getZoneCapacity | Retrieve capacity limits by zone and storage type |
| getThroughputLimits | Query throughput constraints by operation and shift |
| getDockAvailability | Check dock door availability and scheduling constraints |

## Usage

```typescript
import { establishDistributionCenterLayoutConstraints } from '@headlessly/establish-distribution-center-layout-constraints'

const client = establishDistributionCenterLayoutConstraints()

// Define zone capacities
const zones = await client.defineZoneCapacities({
  facilityId: 'DC-southeast',
  zones: [
    { name: 'bulk-storage', maxPallets: 3000 },
    { name: 'pick-zone', maxPallets: 800 },
    { name: 'cold-storage', maxPallets: 500 }
  ]
})

// Set throughput limits per shift
const limits = await client.setThroughputLimits({
  facilityId: 'DC-southeast',
  receiving: { palletsPerHour: 60 },
  picking: { ordersPerHour: 120 },
  shipping: { loadsPerShift: 25 }
})
```
