# Establish distribution planning constraints

> Business-as-Code definition for distribution planning constraints. Models distribution center layout, inventory management, transportation, and storage constraints as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Instituting the constraints for planning of distribution process. Create a plan that specifies every element in the distribution process from the blueprint of the distribution centers to how and when the inventory would reach the distribution centers.

## GraphDL

```yaml
establish:
  object: Distribution Planning Constraints
  actor: DistributionPlanner
  result: ConstraintProfile
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| setLayoutConstraints | Define distribution center floor plan and throughput limits |
| setInventoryConstraints | Establish min/max stock levels and reorder policies |
| setTransportConstraints | Define carrier capacity, route restrictions, and delivery windows |
| setStorageConstraints | Specify storage type, temperature, and capacity limits |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| layoutConstraintsSet | Distribution center layout constraints documented |
| inventoryConstraintsSet | Inventory management parameters established |
| transportConstraintsSet | Transportation management limits defined |
| storageConstraintsSet | Storage management constraints specified |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getConstraintsByFacility | Retrieve all constraints for a specific distribution center |
| findConstraintViolations | Identify operations exceeding defined constraints |
| getCapacityLimits | Query storage and throughput capacity limits |

## Usage

```typescript
import { establishDistributionPlanningConstraints } from '@headlessly/establish-distribution-planning-constraints'

const client = establishDistributionPlanningConstraints()

// Set inventory management constraints
const inventoryConstraints = await client.setInventoryConstraints({
  facility: 'DC-East',
  minStockDays: 7,
  maxStockDays: 30,
  reorderPoint: 'dynamic',
  safetyStockPolicy: 'service-level-based'
})

// Define transportation constraints
const transportConstraints = await client.setTransportConstraints({
  facility: 'DC-East',
  maxDailyShipments: 200,
  deliveryWindows: ['06:00-18:00'],
  carrierCapacity: { truckload: 50, ltl: 100 }
})
