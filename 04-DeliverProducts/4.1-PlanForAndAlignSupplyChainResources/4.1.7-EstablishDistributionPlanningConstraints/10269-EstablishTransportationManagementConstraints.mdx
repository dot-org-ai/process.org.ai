# Establish transportation management constraints

> Business-as-Code definition for transportation management constraint establishment. Models carrier capacity limits, transit time windows, and modal restrictions as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Identifying any potential constraints while deciding on the dispatch and delivery plan from the source to the various distribution centers. Decide how the inventory will be transported , which and how many transportation means to use, what route to take, etc.

## Process Hierarchy

```mermaid

    A[Establish transportation management constraints]
    A --> B[Set maximum and minimum shipment volumes per carrier]
    A --> C[Establish acceptable transit time ranges by lane and mo]
    A --> D[Define which transport modes are permitted for product ]
    A --> E[Set maximum freight cost per unit or shipment for each ]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
establish:
  object: Transportation Management Constraints
  actor: TransportationPolicyManager
  result: TransportationConstraintSet
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineCarrierCapacityLimits | Set maximum and minimum shipment volumes per carrier |
| setTransitTimeWindows | Establish acceptable transit time ranges by lane and mode |
| configureModalRestrictions | Define which transport modes are permitted for product categories |
| establishCostCeilings | Set maximum freight cost per unit or shipment for each lane |
| documentTransportConstraints | Publish consolidated transportation constraints for planning |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| carrierCapacityLimitsDefined | Carrier volume limits established for all lanes |
| transitTimeWindowsSet | Acceptable transit times configured by lane and mode |
| modalRestrictionsConfigured | Transport mode permissions defined for product categories |
| costCeilingsEstablished | Maximum freight cost limits set per lane |
| transportConstraintsDocumented | Transportation constraints published to planning systems |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getCarrierConstraints | Retrieve carrier capacity limits and allocation by lane |
| getTransitTimeRequirements | Query transit time windows for specific origin-destination pairs |
| getModalOptions | List permitted transport modes for a product and route |

## Usage

```typescript
import { establishTransportationManagementConstraints } from '@headlessly/establish-transportation-management-constraints'

const client = establishTransportationManagementConstraints()

// Define carrier capacity limits
const limits = await client.defineCarrierCapacityLimits({
  carrierId: 'carrier-fastfreight',
  lanes: [
    { origin: 'WH-central', destination: 'DC-east', maxLoadsPerWeek: 15 },
    { origin: 'WH-central', destination: 'DC-south', maxLoadsPerWeek: 10 }
  ]
})

// Set transit time windows
const windows = await client.setTransitTimeWindows({
  lane: { origin: 'WH-central', destination: 'DC-east' },
  minDays: 1,
  maxDays: 3,
  mode: 'truckload'
})
```
