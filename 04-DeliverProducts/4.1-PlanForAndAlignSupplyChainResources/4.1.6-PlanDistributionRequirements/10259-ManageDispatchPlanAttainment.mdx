# Manage dispatch plan attainment

> Business-as-Code definition for dispatch plan attainment management. Models dispatch execution tracking, variance analysis, and corrective action as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Accomplishing the dispatch plan. Strictly follow the schedule, and adjust for deviations. Coordinate with the concerned authorities at various destinations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageDispatchPlanAttainment } from '@headlessly/manage-dispatch-plan-attainment'

const client = manageDispatchPlanAttainment()

// Track dispatch execution against plan
const tracking = await client.trackDispatchExecution({
  planId: 'DISP-2025-0601',
  period: '2025-06-01',
  includeCarrierData: true
})

// Measure attainment rate
const attainment = await client.measureAttainmentRate({
  period: 'week-23-2025',
  byDestination: true
})
```
