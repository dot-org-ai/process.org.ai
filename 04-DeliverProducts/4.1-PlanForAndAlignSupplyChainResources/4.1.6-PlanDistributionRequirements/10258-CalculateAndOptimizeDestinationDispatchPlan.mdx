# Calculate and optimize destination dispatch plan

> Business-as-Code definition for destination dispatch plan optimization. Models dispatch timing, route selection, and delivery scheduling as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Estimating the timing and duration of the delivery of the inventory from the source to the destination. Plan the logistic details of all the distribution routes and activities.

## GraphDL

```yaml
calculate:
  object: And Optimize Destination Dispatch Plan
  actor: DispatchPlanner
  result: OptimizedDispatchPlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| calculateDispatchWindows | Determine optimal dispatch timing for each destination based on transit times |
| selectDeliveryRoutes | Choose the most cost-effective and timely routes for dispatches |
| optimizeDispatchSequence | Order dispatches to maximize vehicle utilization and minimize wait times |
| balanceDispatchLoads | Distribute shipment volumes evenly across available dispatch windows |
| validateDispatchFeasibility | Verify that dispatch plans meet carrier capacity and destination constraints |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| dispatchWindowsCalculated | Optimal dispatch timing determined for all destinations |
| deliveryRoutesSelected | Routes chosen for all planned dispatches |
| dispatchSequenceOptimized | Dispatch ordering finalized for maximum efficiency |
| dispatchLoadsBalanced | Shipment volumes distributed across dispatch windows |
| dispatchFeasibilityValidated | Dispatch plan verified against all constraints |

## Searches

| Search | Description |

## Usage

```typescript
import { calculateAndOptimizeDestinationDispatchPlan } from '@headlessly/calculate-and-optimize-destination-dispatch-plan'

const client = calculateAndOptimizeDestinationDispatchPlan()

// Calculate dispatch windows for destinations
const windows = await client.calculateDispatchWindows({
  originWarehouse: 'WH-central',
  destinations: ['DC-east', 'DC-south', 'DC-west'],
  maxTransitDays: 3
})

// Optimize dispatch sequence
const plan = await client.optimizeDispatchSequence({
  dispatchWindowId: windows.id,
  objective: 'minimize-cost',
  carrierPreferences: ['preferred-carrier-A']
})
```
