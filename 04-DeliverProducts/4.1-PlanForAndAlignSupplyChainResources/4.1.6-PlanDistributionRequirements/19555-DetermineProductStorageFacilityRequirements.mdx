# Determine product storage facility requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for storage facility requirements planning. Models space assessment, environmental controls, and facility capacity planning as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Evaluate constraints, needs, parameters, and conditions for physical storage and retrieval of components or products for future use or shipment in a storage facility within a certain timeframe.

const client = determineProductStorageFacilityRequirements()

// Assess storage space needs for a product category
const spaceNeeds = await client.assessStorageSpaceNeeds({
  productCategory: 'consumer-electronics',
  forecastedVolume: { pallets: 5000, turnoverDays: 30 },
  storageType: 'selective-racking'
})

// Plan facility capacity over a three-year horizon
const plan = await client.planFacilityCapacity({
  facilityId: 'DC-southeast',
  horizon: { years: 3 },
  growthRate: 0.08
})
```
