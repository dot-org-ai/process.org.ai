# Plan distribution requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for distribution requirements planning. Models master data maintenance, inventory requirements, dispatch optimization, replenishment planning, and capacity utilization as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Maintaining master data of finished products and inventory. Identify the requirements of finished products at the destination, as well as partner requirements. Calculate the consolidation at source. Manage replenishment planning. Create and administer a dispatch plan. Calculate load plans for destinations and partners. Manage the cost of supplying these products. Ensure effective utilization of capacity.
