# Manage cost of supply

> Business-as-Code definition for supply cost management. Models total cost of supply analysis, cost allocation, and cost reduction opportunity identification as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Managing all expenses to provide products/services in the market. Estimate the overall cost of supplying of products/inventory, including the cost distributing it through various partners and channels. Consider the cost of all the logistical processes that occur from the moment a product is ready to be dispatched to the time it reaches the destination.

const client = manageCostOfSupply()

// Calculate total cost of supply
const costs = await client.calculateTotalCostOfSupply({
  productFamily: 'consumer-electronics',
  period: 'Q2-2025',
  includeComponents: ['production', 'warehousing', 'transportation', 'duties']
})

// Identify cost drivers
const drivers = await client.identifyCostDrivers({
  costAnalysisId: costs.id,
  topN: 10,
  threshold: 0.05
})
