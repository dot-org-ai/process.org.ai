# Manage capacity utilization

> Business-as-Code definition for capacity utilization management. Models capacity measurement, bottleneck identification, and utilization optimization as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Determining the capacity utilization of the organization's production process. Realize the extent to which an enterprise uses its installed productive capacity (i.e., the relationship between output and the potential output if capacity was fully used).

## Process Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Manage capacity utilization]
    A --> B[Calculate actual output relative to maximum productive ]
    A --> C[Locate constraint points that limit overall throughput]
    A --> D[Project future capacity requirements based on demand tr]
    A --> E[Reallocate resources to improve utilization across faci]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
manage:
  object: Capacity Utilization
  actor: CapacityPlanner
  result: CapacityUtilizationReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| measureCapacityUtilization | Calculate actual output relative to maximum productive capacity |
| identifyBottlenecks | Locate constraint points that limit overall throughput |
| forecastCapacityNeeds | Project future capacity requirements based on demand trends |
| optimizeResourceAllocation | Reallocate resources to improve utilization across facilities |
| planCapacityAdjustments | Propose capacity expansions, reductions, or shifts between facilities |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| capacityUtilizationMeasured | Utilization rates calculated across all production facilities |
| bottlenecksIdentified | Throughput constraints detected and documented |
| capacityNeedsForecasted | Future capacity requirements projected |
| resourceAllocationOptimized | Resources reallocated for improved utilization |
| capacityAdjustmentsPlanned | Capacity change recommendations prepared |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getUtilizationRates | Retrieve capacity utilization by facility, line, or period |
| findBottleneckResources | Identify resources operating above capacity threshold |
| getCapacityForecast | Query projected capacity needs versus available capacity |

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageCapacityUtilization } from '@headlessly/manage-capacity-utilization'

const client = manageCapacityUtilization()

// Measure capacity utilization across plants
const utilization = await client.measureCapacityUtilization({
  facilities: ['plant-midwest', 'plant-east'],
  period: '2025-05',
  granularity: 'daily'
})

// Identify bottleneck resources
const bottlenecks = await client.identifyBottlenecks({
  facilityId: 'plant-midwest',
  threshold: 0.90,
  includeRootCause: true
})
```
