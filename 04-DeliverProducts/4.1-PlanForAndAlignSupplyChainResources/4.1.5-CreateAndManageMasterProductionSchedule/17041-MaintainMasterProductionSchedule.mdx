# Maintain master production schedule

> Business-as-Code definition for maintaining the master production schedule. Models the ongoing management, adjustment, and optimization of production scheduling across planning horizons.

## Overview

Supervising and overseeing the plan for internal activities such as production, inventory, and staffing. Set the quantity of items to produce each week of a short-range planning horizon.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| reviewScheduleAdherence | Evaluate current production against planned schedule milestones |
| adjustProductionQuantities | Modify weekly production quantities based on demand changes or capacity shifts |
| resolveScheduleConflicts | Identify and resolve resource conflicts across production lines |
| updatePlanningHorizon | Extend or shift the rolling planning window for upcoming periods |
| incorporateChangeOrders | Integrate engineering change orders and product revisions into the schedule |
| rebalanceWorkloads | Redistribute production loads across lines to optimize throughput |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| scheduleAdherenceReviewed | Production schedule adherence assessment completed |
| productionQuantitiesAdjusted | Weekly production quantities modified and communicated |
| scheduleConflictsResolved | Resource conflicts identified and resolution applied |
| planningHorizonUpdated | Rolling planning horizon extended or shifted |
| changeOrdersIncorporated | Engineering changes reflected in production schedule |
| workloadsRebalanced | Production loads redistributed across manufacturing lines |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getScheduleVariances | Retrieve deviations between planned and actual production output |
| findConflictingOrders | Identify production orders competing for the same resources or time slots |
| getCapacityForecast | Query available capacity by production line and time period |
| getChangeOrderQueue | List pending engineering change orders awaiting schedule integration |

const mps = maintainMasterProductionSchedule()

// Review adherence to current schedule
const variances = await mps.reviewScheduleAdherence({
  plantId: 'plant-midwest-01',
  periodStart: '2025-07-01',
  periodEnd: '2025-07-07'
})

// Adjust quantities based on demand shift
await mps.adjustProductionQuantities({
  scheduleId: variances.scheduleId,
  lineItems: [
    { sku: 'WIDGET-A', weekOf: '2025-07-14', newQuantity: 1200 }
  ],
