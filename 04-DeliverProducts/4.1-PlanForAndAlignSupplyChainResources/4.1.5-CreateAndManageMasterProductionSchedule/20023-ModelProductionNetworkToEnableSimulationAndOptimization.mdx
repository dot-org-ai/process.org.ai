# Model production network to enable simulation and optimization

> Business-as-Code definition for modeling the production network. Enables digital twin simulation and optimization of manufacturing capacity, resource flows, and product routing across plants.

## Overview

Create representative logical system that provides the framework to attain strategic objectives based on resources, product volumes, and processes. Provides the general sequential flow and capacity requirement relationships among raw materials, parts, resources, finished products, and product families.
