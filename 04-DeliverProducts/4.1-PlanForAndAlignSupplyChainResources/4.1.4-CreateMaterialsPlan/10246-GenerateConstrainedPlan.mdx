# Generate constrained plan

> Business-as-Code definition for constrained materials plan generation. Models capacity-limited planning, supplier constraint application, lead-time offsetting, and feasible plan creation as programmable planning workflows.

## Overview

Generating a bounded plan that takes stock of the actual supply chain scenario. Take stock of all information collected while creating an inventory supply plan.

    A[Create materials plan] --> B[Generate constrained plan]
    A --> C[Monitor material specifications]
    A --> D[Define production balance and control]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
generate:
  object: Constrained Plan
  actor: MaterialsPlanner
  result: ConstrainedMaterialsPlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| applySupplierConstraints | Limit purchase plan to confirmed supplier capacity |
| applyCapacityConstraints | Bound plan by production and storage capacity limits |
| offsetLeadTimes | Adjust order timing based on actual supplier lead times |
| generateFeasiblePlan | Produce a materials plan achievable within all constraints |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| supplierConstraintsApplied | Purchase plan bounded by supplier capacity |
| capacityConstraintsApplied | Plan limited by production and storage constraints |
| leadTimesOffset | Order dates adjusted for actual lead times |
| feasiblePlanGenerated | Constrained materials plan completed |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getConstrainedPlan | Retrieve constrained plan by period or material |
| getConstraintSummary | Query which constraints are binding in the plan |
| getPlanFeasibility | Check feasibility status of the constrained plan |

const client = generateConstrainedPlan()

// Generate feasible plan
const plan = await client.generateFeasiblePlan({
  unconstrainedPlanId: 'UCP-2025-Q3',
  constraints: ['supplier-capacity', 'warehouse-space', 'production-capacity'],
  prioritizationRule: 'revenue-weighted'
