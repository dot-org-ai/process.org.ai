# Create unconstrained plan

> Business-as-Code definition for unconstrained materials plan creation. Models demand-driven materials requirements calculation without capacity or supply limitations as a programmable planning workflow.

## Overview

Developing a plan for raw materials and other inventory items in order to meet market demand. Ensure the availability of all inventory items such as raw materials and spares. Create a blueprint in line with Define labor and materials policies [10230].

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
create:
  object: Unconstrained Plan
  actor: MaterialsPlanner
  result: UnconstrainedMaterialsPlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| explodeBOM | Decompose finished goods demand into component material requirements |
| calculateGrossRequirements | Compute total material quantities needed to meet demand forecast |
| netAgainstInventory | Subtract on-hand and on-order inventory from gross requirements |
| generatePurchasePlan | Produce time-phased purchase recommendations without constraints |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| bomExploded | Bill-of-materials explosion completed for all demand |
| grossRequirementsCalculated | Total material needs computed for planning horizon |
| inventoryNetted | Net requirements determined after inventory offset |
| purchasePlanGenerated | Unconstrained purchase plan created |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getGrossRequirements | Retrieve gross material requirements by item or period |
| getNetRequirements | Query net requirements after inventory netting |
| getUnconstrainedPlan | Retrieve the full unconstrained materials plan |

```typescript
import { createUnconstrainedPlan } from '@headlessly/create-unconstrained-plan'

const client = createUnconstrainedPlan()

// Generate purchase plan
const plan = await client.generatePurchasePlan({
  demandForecastId: 'DF-2025-Q3',
  planningHorizon: 12,
  granularity: 'weekly',
  includeSpares: true
})
