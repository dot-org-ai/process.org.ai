# Monitor material specifications

> Business-as-Code definition for material specification monitoring. Models specification verification, change tracking, compliance validation, and supplier notification as programmable surveillance workflows.

## Overview

Observing and surveying all inventory items in order to check for the veracity of their specifications. Monitor various attributes and characteristics for respective inventory items such as density, volume, and size, as well as contextualized specifications particular to the respective materials.

```typescript
import { monitorMaterialSpecifications } from '@headlessly/monitor-material-specifications'

const client = monitorMaterialSpecifications()

// Verify specifications
const result = await client.verifySpecifications({
  materialId: 'MAT-4500',
  attributes: ['tensile-strength', 'density', 'purity'],
  toleranceMode: 'strict'
})
