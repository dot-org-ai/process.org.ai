# Define production balance and control

> Business-as-Code definition for production balance and control definition. Models production rate leveling, inventory buffer sizing, work-in-process control, and line balancing as programmable production control configurations.

## Overview

Defining an equitable volume for the production of products/services that adheres to an equilibrium value, and creating a scheme of control for processing items. Create schematics for systematically planning, coordinating, and directing the manufacturing activities in line with the production balance determined.

const client = defineProductionBalanceAndControl()

// Set production rates
const rates = await client.setProductionRates({
  workCenter: 'WC-ASSEMBLY-01',
  targetRate: 120,
  rateUnit: 'units-per-shift',
  levelingStrategy: 'mixed-model'
})
