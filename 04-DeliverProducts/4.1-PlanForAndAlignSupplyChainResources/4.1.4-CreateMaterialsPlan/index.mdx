# Create materials plan

> Business-as-Code definition for materials requirements planning. Models unconstrained and constrained planning, supplier collaboration, critical materials identification, and production balance control as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Developing a scheme that allows for advance planning for the availability of raw materials and spares. Start with an unconstrained plan, and refine based on supply chain realities by identifying critical materials required for production, checking material specifications, and collaborating with all vendors over the supply.

const client = createMaterialsPlan()

// Create unconstrained plan from demand forecast
const unconstrained = await client.createUnconstrainedPlan({
  demandForecastId: 'DF-2025-Q3',
  bomVersion: 'current',
  planningHorizon: { weeks: 16 }
})

// Identify at-risk materials
const risks = await client.identifyCriticalMaterials({
  planId: unconstrained.id,
