# Identify critical materials and supplier capacity

> Business-as-Code definition for critical materials and supplier capacity identification. Models material criticality assessment, supplier capacity profiling, single-source risk detection, and mitigation planning as programmable risk workflows.

## Overview

Identifying principal materials needed for the manufacturing process and the levels of supply that may be ensured for them. Determine the essential and crucial inventory items required for the smooth functioning of all manufacturing processes. Estimate the average, peak, and baseline capacities of various vendors and suppliers. Establish the capability of individual suppliers from the market and the vendors.

| profileSupplierCapacity | Document baseline, average, and peak capacity for each supplier |
| detectSingleSourceRisks | Identify materials dependent on a single supplier |
| developMitigationPlans | Create contingency plans for critical material supply risks |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| materialCriticalityClassified | Materials rated by supply risk and production impact |
| supplierCapacityProfiled | Supplier capacity data documented and analyzed |
| singleSourceRisksDetected | Single-source dependencies identified and flagged |

  productLine: 'Automotive Components',
  riskFactors: ['supply-concentration', 'lead-time', 'substitutability'],
  thresholdLevel: 'high'
})
