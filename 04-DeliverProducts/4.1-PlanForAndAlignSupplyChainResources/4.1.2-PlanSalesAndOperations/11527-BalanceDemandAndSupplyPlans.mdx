# Balance demand and supply plans

> Business-as-Code definition for demand and supply plan balancing. Models gap analysis, scenario evaluation, trade-off decisions, and consensus plan generation as programmable balancing workflows.

## Overview

Reconciling demand forecasts with supply capabilities to identify gaps, evaluate trade-offs, and arrive at a feasible operating plan. Adjust production schedules, inventory targets, and procurement plans to align available supply with projected demand across all product families.

## GraphDL

```yaml

  object: Demand And Supply Plans
  actor: SupplyChainPlanner
  result: BalancedPlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyGaps | Compare demand forecast against supply capacity to find imbalances |
| evaluateScenarios | Model alternative plans to resolve demand-supply gaps |
| resolveTradeOffs | Make trade-off decisions between service level, cost, and inventory |
| publishBalancedPlan | Distribute the agreed demand-supply plan to execution teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| gapsIdentified | Demand-supply imbalances documented with root causes |
| scenariosEvaluated | Alternative resolution scenarios analyzed and compared |
| tradeOffsResolved | Cross-functional agreement reached on plan adjustments |
| balancedPlanPublished | Consensus plan distributed to production and procurement |
