# Plan for and align supply chain resources

> Business-as-Code definition for supply chain planning and alignment. Models demand forecasting, production scheduling, materials planning, and distribution coordination as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Creating strategies for production and materials. Handle the demand for the products of the organization. Develop plans for handling materials. Develop and administer the schedule for master production. Plan for distribution requirements and its constraints by reviewing and assessing distribution policies and performance and by establishing quality standards and procedures.

const client = planForAndAlignSupplyChainResources()

// Build demand forecast
const forecast = await client.forecastDemand({
  productFamily: 'consumer-electronics',
  horizon: { months: 6 },
  method: 'consensus'
})

// Create constrained materials plan
const materialsPlan = await client.createMaterialsPlan({
  forecastId: forecast.id,
  supplierConstraints: true,
  capacityLimits: true
})

// Generate master production schedule
const schedule = await client.scheduleMasterProduction({
  materialsPlanId: materialsPlan.id,
  planningPeriod: 'Q3-2025'
})
