# Develop quality standards and procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for quality standards and procedures development. Models quality target setting, test procedure design, and specification communication as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Developing standards and procedures for maintaining the quality of products/services. Establish desired quality targets. Create standardized procedures for the quality. Ensure quality specifications are effectively communicated.

const client = developQualityStandardsAndProcedures()

// Establish quality targets for a product line
const targets = await client.establishQualityTargets({
  productLine: 'precision-components',
  tolerances: { dimensional: '0.01mm', surface: 'Ra 0.8' },
  defectRateMax: 50
})

// Develop standard testing procedure
const procedure = await client.developTestProcedures({
