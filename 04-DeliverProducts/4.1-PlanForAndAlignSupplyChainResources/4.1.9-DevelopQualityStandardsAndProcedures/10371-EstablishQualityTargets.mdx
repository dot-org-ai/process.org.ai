# Establish quality targets

> Business-as-Code definition for quality target establishment. Models quality goal setting, acceptance criteria definition, and quality level benchmarking as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Defining specific qualitative and quantitative target figures for products and manufacturing processes. This involves establishing measurable quality objectives such as defect rates, yield thresholds, and customer satisfaction benchmarks, then validating these targets against industry standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational capability. Quality targets serve as the foundation for all downstream testing procedures and quality control activities.

const client = establishQualityTargets()

// Define quality goals for a product line
const goals = await client.defineQualityGoals({
  productLine: 'consumer-electronics',
  targets: [
    { metric: 'defect-rate', maxPPM: 50 },
    { metric: 'first-pass-yield', minPercent: 98 }
  ]
})

// Benchmark against industry standards
const benchmark = await client.benchmarkQualityLevels({
  industry: 'electronics-manufacturing',
  metrics: ['defect-rate', 'customer-return-rate'],
  source: 'APQC-benchmark-database'
})
