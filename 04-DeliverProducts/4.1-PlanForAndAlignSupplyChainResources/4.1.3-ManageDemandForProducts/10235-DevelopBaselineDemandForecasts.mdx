# Develop baseline demand forecasts

> Business-as-Code definition for baseline demand forecast development. Models statistical forecasting using historical data, market analysis, seasonality patterns, and trend extrapolation as programmable forecast generation.

## Overview

Identify the bedrock levels of market demand anticipated for the organization's products/services. Estimate future demand for product and services using historical data, analysis of the market environment and any externalities, etc. to create ex ante approximations.
