# Monitor activity against demand forecast and revise forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for demand forecast monitoring and revision. Models actual-versus-forecast tracking, deviation detection, root cause analysis, and forecast adjustment as programmable monitoring workflows.

## Overview

Picking out any activity that deviates from the forecast, and adjusting it. Closely track and study the levels of demand as they emerge. Refine the consensus forecast as needed.

## GraphDL

```yaml
monitor:
  object: Activity Against Demand Forecast And Revise Forecast
  actor: DemandPlanner
  result: RevisedForecast
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| trackActualsVsForecast | Compare actual demand against forecasted volumes by period |
| detectDeviations | Identify significant variances requiring forecast adjustment |
| analyzeDeviationCauses | Investigate root causes of demand deviations |
| reviseForecast | Update the demand forecast to reflect emerging demand patterns |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| actualsTracked | Actual demand compared against forecast for current period |
| deviationsDetected | Significant forecast variances identified and flagged |
| deviationCausesAnalyzed | Root causes of demand deviations documented |
| forecastRevised | Demand forecast updated with revised projections |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getForecastVariance | Retrieve actual-versus-forecast variance by product or period |
| getDeviationAlerts | Query active deviation alerts above threshold |
| getRevisionHistory | Retrieve forecast revision history and change reasons |

// Track actuals vs forecast
const variance = await client.trackActualsVsForecast({
