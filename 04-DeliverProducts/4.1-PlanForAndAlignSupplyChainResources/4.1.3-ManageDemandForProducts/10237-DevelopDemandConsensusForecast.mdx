# Develop demand consensus forecast

> Business-as-Code definition for demand consensus forecast creation. Models cross-functional reconciliation of baseline, customer, and market inputs into a single agreed-upon demand plan as a programmable consensus workflow.

## Overview

Arriving at a consensus over the forecasted levels of demand for products/services. Consensus is achieved by juxtaposing decisions developed in the baseline forecast with those reached at by collaborating with customers. Enlist senior-level decision makers of the sales and marketing functions.
