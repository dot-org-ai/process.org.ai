# Collaborate demand with customers

> Business-as-Code definition for customer demand collaboration. Models customer engagement, demand signal capture, usage pattern analysis, and collaborative forecast refinement as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Working closely with the organization's customers to understand their drives and behavior, with the objective of estimating future demand. Reach out to customers through various means to understand their behavior patterns, usage elasticity, and degree of variability--and ultimately determine demand for each offering.
