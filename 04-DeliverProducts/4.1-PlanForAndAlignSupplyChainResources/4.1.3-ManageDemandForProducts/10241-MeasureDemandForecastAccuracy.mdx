# Measure demand forecast accuracy

> Business-as-Code definition for demand forecast accuracy measurement. Models MAPE calculation, bias analysis, accuracy trending, and forecast reliability reporting as programmable measurement workflows.

## Overview

Calculating and inspecting the accuracy of demand forecasts. Use metrics to check the reliability of the forecasts created.
