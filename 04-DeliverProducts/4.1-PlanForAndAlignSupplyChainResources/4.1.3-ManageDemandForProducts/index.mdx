# Manage demand for products

> Business-as-Code definition for product demand management. Models baseline forecasting, customer collaboration, consensus building, available-to-promise calculation, and forecast accuracy measurement as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Forecasting demand for products using secondary research and customer feedback. Refine these forecasts. Inspect the approach used in creating forecasts, and determine its accuracy.

const client = manageDemandForProducts()

// Generate baseline statistical forecast
const baseline = await client.developBaselineForecast({
  productFamily: 'consumer-appliances',
  horizon: { months: 12 },
  method: 'exponential-smoothing'
})

// Check available-to-promise for a sales inquiry
const atp = await client.determineATP({
  productId: 'SKU-3200',
  requestedQuantity: 500,
  requestedDate: '2025-07-15'
})
