# Optimize transportation schedules and costs

> Business-as-Code definition for optimize transportation schedules and costs. Models the logistics governance processes to ensure efficient movement, storage, and compliance of goods throughout the supply chain.

## Overview

Optimizing the schedule and costs of transportation services. Design a logistics strategy by strategically creating delivery routes and systems, which optimizes the overall transportation schedules and costs. Evaluate different transportation sources in order to select the most appropriate and cost-effective sources.
