# Provide logistics governance

> Business-as-Code definition for logistics governance. Models customer-to-logistics translation, network design, transportation optimization, delivery policy management, and reverse logistics strategy as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Outlining the strategy for managing logistics. Translate customer requirements logistic requirements. Create an efficient logistic network and outsourcing portions of logistics activities. Design a logistics strategy that optimizes transportation costs and schedule. Define key performance indicators.
