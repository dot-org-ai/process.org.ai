# Track inventory accuracy

> Business-as-Code definition for track inventory accuracy. Models the warehousing processes to ensure efficient movement, storage, and compliance of goods throughout the supply chain.

## Overview

Monitoring any discrepancies between electronic records that represent the inventory and the physical state of the inventory. Look for discrepancies such as phantom inventory, which includes products that an inventory accounting system considers to be available at the storage location but are not actually available.
