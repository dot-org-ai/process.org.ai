# Implement procurement initiatives

> Business-as-Code definition for procurement initiative implementation. Models cross-functional buying teams, buying consortiums, integrated supply, e-procurement, and cost reduction programs as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Deploying strategic procurement improvement programs to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and modernize purchasing operations. Establish cross-functional buying teams, form buying consortiums for volume leverage, implement integrated supply partnerships, deploy e-procurement systems, and execute purchasing cost reduction programs.
