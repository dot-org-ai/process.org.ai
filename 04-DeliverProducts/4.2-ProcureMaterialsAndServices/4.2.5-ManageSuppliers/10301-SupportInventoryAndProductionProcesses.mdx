# Support inventory and production processes

> Business-as-Code definition for support inventory and production processes. Models the supplier-performance processes within procurement to ensure materials and services are acquired efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Overview

Support inventory and production processes by analyzing impact of procurement decisions and collaborating to constantly improve. (For example, perhaps minimum order requirements could be negotiated to be lower, to reduce excessive inventory and make production more flexible.)
