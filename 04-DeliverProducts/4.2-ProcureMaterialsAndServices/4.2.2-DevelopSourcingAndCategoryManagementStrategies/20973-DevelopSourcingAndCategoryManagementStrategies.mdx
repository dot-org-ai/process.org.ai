# Develop sourcing and category management strategies

> Business-as-Code definition for sourcing and category management strategy development. Models spend segmentation, category analysis, supply market assessment, strategic sourcing methodology, and value optimization as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Deploying a strategic sourcing methodology to segment the majority of organizational spend based on external supply markets (versus individual suppliers or internal stakeholders) to reduce the cost of buying goods and services, reduce risk in the supply chain, and maximize value delivered from the supply base. This approach typically includes cross-functional management of categories, examining the entire category spend, how the organization uses the products or services within the category, the marketplace, and major suppliers.
