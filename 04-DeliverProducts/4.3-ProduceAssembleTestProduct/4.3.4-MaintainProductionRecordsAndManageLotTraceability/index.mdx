# Maintain production records and manage lot traceability

> Business-as-Code definition for production records and lot traceability. Models lot and batch numbering, usage tracking, goods issue processing, and material genealogy as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Maintaining production records and managing traceability of production lots and batches through the manufacturing process. Define lot and batch numbering systems, track material usage and consumption, perform goods issue transactions, and enable end-to-end traceability from raw materials through finished goods.

## Usage

```typescript
import { maintainProductionRecordsAndManageLotTraceability } from '@headlessly/maintain-production-records-and-manage-lot-traceability'

const client = maintainProductionRecordsAndManageLotTraceability()

// Perform goods issue to production
const issue = await client.performGoodsIssue({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-MFG-2025-0890',
  materials: [{ id: 'MAT-001', quantity: 500, lotNumber: 'LOT-RM-2025-042' }],
  issuedBy: 'warehouse-clerk-01'
