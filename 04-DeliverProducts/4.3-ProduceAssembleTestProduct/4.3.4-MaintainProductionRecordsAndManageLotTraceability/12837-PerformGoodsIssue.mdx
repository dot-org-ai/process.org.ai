# Perform goods issue

> Business-as-Code definition for perform goods issue. Models the traceability activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Issuing raw materials and components from inventory to production orders. Goods issue records the movement of materials from warehouse stock to the manufacturing floor, updating inventory positions and enabling accurate production cost tracking.

const client = performGoodsIssue()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-TRAC-001'
})
```
