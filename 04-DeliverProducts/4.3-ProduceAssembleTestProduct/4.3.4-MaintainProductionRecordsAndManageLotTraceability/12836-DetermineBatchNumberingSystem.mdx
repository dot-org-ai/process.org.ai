# Determine batch numbering system

> Business-as-Code definition for determine batch numbering system. Models the traceability activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Defining the numbering scheme and conventions used to identify and track production batches. A batch numbering system provides unique identification for groups of products manufactured under identical conditions, enabling traceability and recall management.

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-TRAC-001'
})
```
