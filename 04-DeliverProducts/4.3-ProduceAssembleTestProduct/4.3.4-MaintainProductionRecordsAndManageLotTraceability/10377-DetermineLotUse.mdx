```

## GraphDL

```yaml
determine:
  object: Lot Use
  actor: ProductionRecordsManager
  result: DetermineOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| determineActivity | Determine lot use per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for determine lot use |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core traceability tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for determine lot use |
| processExecuted | Core traceability tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of determine lot use activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for traceability activities |

## Usage

```typescript
import { determineLotUse } from '@headlessly/determine-lot-use'

const client = determineLotUse()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-TRAC-001'
})
```
