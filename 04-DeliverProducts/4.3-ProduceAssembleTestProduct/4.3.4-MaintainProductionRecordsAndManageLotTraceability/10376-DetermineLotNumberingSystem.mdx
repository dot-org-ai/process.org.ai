# Determine lot numbering system

> Business-as-Code definition for determine lot numbering system. Models the traceability activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Allotting an identification number to a particular quantity or lot of material manufactured. Assign lot numbers on the basis of specific production units, material similarity, etc. Place lot numbers on the outside of packaging.
