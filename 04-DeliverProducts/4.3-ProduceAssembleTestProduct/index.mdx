# Produce/Assemble/Test product

> Business-as-Code definition for manufacturing operations. Models production scheduling, assembly execution, quality testing, lot traceability, and performance assessment as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Processing and delivering the finished goods manufactured by the organization. Schedule the production of products. Execute the product production activities. Perform tests to oversee and ensure quality of production. Maintain records of the production process. Track lots.

const client = produceAssembleTestProduct()

// Schedule a production run
const order = await client.scheduleProduction({
  productId: 'SKU-5500',
  quantity: 1000,
  lineId: 'line-A3',
  startDate: '2025-05-01'
})

// Execute quality testing
const results = await client.performQualityTest({
  productionOrderId: order.id,
  testProcedure: 'STP-electrical-safety',
  sampleSize: 50
})

// Track lot traceability
const lot = await client.manageLotTraceability({
  lotNumber: order.lotNumber,
  rawMaterials: ['MAT-001', 'MAT-002'],
  productionDate: '2025-05-02'
})
