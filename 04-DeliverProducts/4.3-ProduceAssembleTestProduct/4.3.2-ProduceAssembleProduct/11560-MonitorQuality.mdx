# Monitor quality

> Business-as-Code definition for monitor quality. Models the manufacturing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Observing and tracking the quality of products during the manufacturing process. Implement statistical process control, in-line inspections, and automated quality checks to detect defects early and maintain consistent product quality throughout production.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
monitor:
  object: Quality
  actor: ProductionManager
  result: MonitorOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| monitorActivity | Monitor quality per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for monitor quality |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core manufacturing tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for monitor quality |
| processExecuted | Core manufacturing tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of monitor quality activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for manufacturing activities |

## Usage

```typescript
import { monitorQuality } from '@headlessly/monitor-quality'

const client = monitorQuality()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-MANU-001'
})
```
