# Produce/Assemble product

> Business-as-Code definition for product manufacturing and assembly. Models raw material management, line execution, quality monitoring, defect rework, process optimization, and performance assessment as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Manufacturing the product. Convert the raw materials to develop consumer-ready products. Manage the raw materials to implement the detailed production schedule. Reproduce defectives to establish and remediate cause. Ensure production optimization and benchmark performance.
