# Manage raw material inventory

> Business-as-Code definition for manage raw material inventory. Models the manufacturing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Administering the inventory of raw materials. Manage the total cost of all component parts in stock but not yet used. Manage the cost of the direct materials (i.e., materials incorporated into the final product) and indirect materials (i.e., materials not incorporated into the final product but consumed during the production process).

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageRawMaterialInventory } from '@headlessly/manage-raw-material-inventory'

const client = manageRawMaterialInventory()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-MANU-001'
})
```
