# Rerun defective items

> Business-as-Code definition for rerun defective items. Models the manufacturing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Reproducing the items produced defectively. Assess the produced items by conducting quality and standardization tests in order to diagnose any discrepancies. Reproduce defective items.

const client = rerunDefectiveItems()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-MANU-001'
})
```
