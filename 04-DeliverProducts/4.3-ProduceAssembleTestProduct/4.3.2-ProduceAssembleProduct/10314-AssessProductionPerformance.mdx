# Assess production performance

> Business-as-Code definition for assess production performance. Models the manufacturing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Analyzing and benchmarking the production process to judge its effectiveness and efficiency. Create production metrics to numerically calculate the performance of the production process.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
assess:
  object: Production Performance
  actor: ProductionManager
  result: AssessOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessActivity | Assess production performance per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for assess production performance |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core manufacturing tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for assess production performance |
| processExecuted | Core manufacturing tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of assess production performance activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for manufacturing activities |

| First Pass Yield | Percentage of products passing quality on first attempt | % |
| Production Cycle Time | Average time to complete assess production performance | Hours |

## Usage

```typescript
import { assessProductionPerformance } from '@headlessly/assess-production-performance'

const client = assessProductionPerformance()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-MANU-001'
})
```
