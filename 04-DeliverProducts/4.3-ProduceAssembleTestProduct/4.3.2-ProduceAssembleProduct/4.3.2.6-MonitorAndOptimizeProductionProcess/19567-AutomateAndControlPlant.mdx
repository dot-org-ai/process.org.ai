# Automate and control plant

> Business-as-Code definition for automate and control plant. Models the process-optimization activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Creating and applying technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products and services. Automation involves a broad range of technologies.

## Usage

```typescript
import { automateAndControlPlant } from '@headlessly/automate-and-control-plant'

const client = automateAndControlPlant()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PROC-001'
})
```
