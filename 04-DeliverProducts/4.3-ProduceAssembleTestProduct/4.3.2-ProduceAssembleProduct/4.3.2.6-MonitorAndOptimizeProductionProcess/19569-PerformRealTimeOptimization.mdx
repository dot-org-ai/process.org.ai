# Perform real-time optimization

> Business-as-Code definition for perform real-time optimization. Models the process-optimization activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Helping organizations increase performance and efficiency, real-time optimization is a category of closed-loop process control that aims at optimizing process performance in real time for systems. It is normally built upon model-based optimization systems and is usually large scale. Real-time optimization automatically detects errors, and can modify and eliminate both random and non-random errors, as well as analyze and monitor all systems involved.

import { performReal-timeOptimization } from '@headlessly/perform-real-time-optimization'

const client = performReal-timeOptimization()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PROC-001'
})
```
