# Perform advanced process control

> Business-as-Code definition for perform advanced process control. Models the process-optimization activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Including a broad range of techniques and technologies implemented within industrial process control systems that are routinely reviewed, audited, and improved, advanced process controls typically address particular performance or economic improvement opportunities. An advanced set of process control measures can be used to reduce variation and identify primary improvement options. Results of analysis are fed back into process design for incorporation into production.

const client = performAdvancedProcessControl()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
