# Monitor and optimize production process

> Business-as-Code definition for production process monitoring and optimization. Models plant automation, advanced process control, real-time optimization, and alarm management as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Integrating different resources in the production process: material, personnel, equipment, robotics, etc. Includes automating and controlling the plant, performing advanced process control and real-time optimization. This activity also includes managing plant alarms and alerts.
