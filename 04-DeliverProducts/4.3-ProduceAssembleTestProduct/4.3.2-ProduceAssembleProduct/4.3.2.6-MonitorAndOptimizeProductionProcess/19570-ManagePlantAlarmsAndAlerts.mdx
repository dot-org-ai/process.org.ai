# Manage plant alarms and alerts

> Business-as-Code definition for manage plant alarms and alerts. Models the process-optimization activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Applying human factors and instrumentation engineering and systems thinking to manage the design of an alarm or alert system to increase its usability. Typical challenges include having too many alarms in a plant, poorly designed alarms/alerts, improperly set alarm/alert points, unclear alarm/alert messages, etc. Poor alarm management is one of the leading causes of unplanned downtime.

const client = managePlantAlarmsAndAlerts()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PROC-001'
})
