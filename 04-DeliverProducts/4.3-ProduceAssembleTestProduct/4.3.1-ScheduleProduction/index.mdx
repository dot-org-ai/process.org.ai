# Schedule production

> Business-as-Code definition for production scheduling. Models plant simulation, line-level planning, detailed scheduling, order creation, and maintenance scheduling as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Scheduling the production of final products. Generate a detailed schedule plan. Create and release production orders and lots. Schedule the planned and unplanned maintenance orders.

## Usage

```typescript
import { scheduleProduction } from '@headlessly/schedule-production'

const client = scheduleProduction()

// Generate detailed production schedule
const schedule = await client.generateDetailedSchedule({
  mpsId: 'MPS-2025-Q3',
  plantId: 'plant-midwest',
  horizon: { weeks: 4 },
  optimizeFor: 'changeover-minimization'
})

// Release production orders to shop floor
const released = await client.releaseOrders({
  scheduleId: schedule.id,
  releaseDate: '2025-05-01',
  lines: ['line-A1', 'line-A2']
})
```
