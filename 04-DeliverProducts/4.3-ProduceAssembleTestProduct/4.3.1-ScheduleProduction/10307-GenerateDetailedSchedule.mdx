# Generate detailed schedule

> Business-as-Code definition for generate detailed schedule. Models the scheduling activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Broadening the line-level plan. Specify all the individual production processes, along with the timing and the duration to come up with a working schedule that tracks the whole process and any deviations that might occur.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
generate:
  object: Detailed Schedule
  actor: ProductionScheduler
  result: GenerateOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| generateActivity | Generate detailed schedule per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for generate detailed schedule |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core scheduling tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for generate detailed schedule |
| processExecuted | Core scheduling tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of generate detailed schedule activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for scheduling activities |

```typescript
import { generateDetailedSchedule } from '@headlessly/generate-detailed-schedule'

const client = generateDetailedSchedule()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-SCHE-001'
})
```
