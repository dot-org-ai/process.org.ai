# Schedule production orders and create lots

> Business-as-Code definition for schedule production orders and create lots. Models the scheduling activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Creating a schedule to commence production of orders received, and creating lots to consolidate the processing. Plan when the production orders are to be initiated by commencing the operations for processing products/services. Specify which materials to produce, where to produce them, which operations will facilitate this, and on which date production is to start. Define the size of production lots, demarcating the durations of batch production.

const client = scheduleProductionOrdersAndCreateLots()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-SCHE-001'
})
```
