# Model and simulate plant

> Business-as-Code definition for model and simulate plant. Models the scheduling activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Creating a representation of plant facilities to optimize material flow, resource utilization, and logistics for all levels of plant planning from global production facilities, through local plants, to specific lines and enabling the comparison of production�alternatives,.

## Usage

```typescript
import { modelAndSimulatePlant } from '@headlessly/model-and-simulate-plant'

const client = modelAndSimulatePlant()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-SCHE-001'
})
```
