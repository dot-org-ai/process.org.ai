# Schedule requested (unplanned) maintenance (work order cycle)

> Business-as-Code definition for schedule requested (unplanned) maintenance (work order cycle). Models the scheduling activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Scheduling requested maintenance in order to address breakdowns where repairs or corrective remedies are needed immediately. Create a scheme for undertaking unplanned maintenance work on equipment/machinery that has come to be in urgent need for it. Express turnaround to redress using specialized personnel.
