# Generate line level plan

> Business-as-Code definition for generate line level plan. Models the scheduling activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Initiating the line-level plan for production. Break down the production schedule into specific lines, specifying the various objectives the production schedule.

## Usage

```typescript
import { generateLineLevelPlan } from '@headlessly/generate-line-level-plan'

const client = generateLineLevelPlan()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-SCHE-001'
})
```
