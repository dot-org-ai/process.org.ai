# Record test results

> Business-as-Code definition for record test results. Models the quality-testing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Documenting the results and outcomes of the quality tests. Track the performance of the production process. Record/Document it to evaluate the qualitative efficiency of the production process. Use electronic devices and software in order to ensure effectiveness in recording the results and outcomes of the test.

const client = recordTestResults()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({

  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-QUAL-001'
})
