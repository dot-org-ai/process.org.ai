# Track and analyze non-conformance trends

> Business-as-Code definition for track and analyze non-conformance trends. Models the quality-testing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Managing and monitoring the occurrences of problems with a process or product. It is important that nonconformance occurrences are tracked in a standardized way so the data can easily be reviewed to assess the impact of the problem. Ongoing analysis of trends in nonconformance gives an organization the ability to make process changes to reduce the incidence and cost of nonconformances.
