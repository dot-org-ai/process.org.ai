# Perform quality testing

> Business-as-Code definition for quality testing execution. Models equipment calibration, standard testing, sample management, result recording, non-conformance tracking, and root cause analysis as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Executing tests to evaluate the quality of the products manufactured. Calibrate the test equipment. Conduct the actual tests. Record the results and outcomes of the quality test conducted.
