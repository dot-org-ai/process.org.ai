# Perform testing using the standard testing procedure

> Business-as-Code definition for perform testing using the standard testing procedure. Models the quality-testing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Performing testing using calibrated equipment in accordance with the standard testing procedure, including adherence to testing time requirements. This process ensures that each product batch or unit is systematically evaluated against defined quality specifications using approved test methods, calibrated instruments, and documented procedures. Test execution includes sample preparation, measurement recording, pass/fail determination, and proper handling of non-conforming items for further disposition.
