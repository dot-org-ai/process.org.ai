# Calibrate test equipment

> Business-as-Code definition for calibrate test equipment. Models the quality-testing activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Regulating the equipment used for performing quality tests. Assess correspondence between the quality testing equipment and the desired quality standards. Ensure the calibration standard is more accurate than the instrument being tested.
