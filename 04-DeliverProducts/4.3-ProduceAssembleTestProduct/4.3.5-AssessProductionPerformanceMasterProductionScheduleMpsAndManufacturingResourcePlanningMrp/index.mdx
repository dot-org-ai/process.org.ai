# Assess production performance (master production schedule -MPS and manufacturing resource planning - MRP)

> Business-as-Code definition for production performance assessment. Models MPS/MRP performance measurement, trend identification, issue detection, reporting, and action planning as programmable workflows.

## Overview

Evaluating production performance against master production schedule (MPS) and manufacturing resource planning (MRP) targets. Establish performance measures and monitoring frequency, calculate actual metrics, identify trends and issues, generate reports, and develop improvement action plans.
