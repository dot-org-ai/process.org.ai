# Prepare appropriate reports

> Business-as-Code definition for prepare appropriate reports. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Creating production performance reports tailored to different stakeholder needs. Generate executive summaries, detailed operational reports, and trend analyses that communicate performance status and support informed decision-making at each organizational level.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| prepareActivity | Prepare appropriate reports per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for prepare appropriate reports |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core performance tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for prepare appropriate reports |
| processExecuted | Core performance tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of prepare appropriate reports activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for performance activities |

## Usage

```typescript
import { prepareAppropriateReports } from '@headlessly/prepare-appropriate-reports'

const client = prepareAppropriateReports()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
