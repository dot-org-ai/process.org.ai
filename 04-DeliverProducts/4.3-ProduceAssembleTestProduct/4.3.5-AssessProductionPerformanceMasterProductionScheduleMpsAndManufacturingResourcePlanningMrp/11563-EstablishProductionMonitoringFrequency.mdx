# Establish production monitoring frequency

> Business-as-Code definition for establish production monitoring frequency. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Setting the frequency at which production performance data is collected, analyzed, and reported. Determine whether real-time, hourly, shift-based, daily, or weekly monitoring provides the right balance of timeliness and analytical value.

const client = establishProductionMonitoringFrequency()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
