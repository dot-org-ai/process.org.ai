# Calculate production performance measures

> Business-as-Code definition for calculate production performance measures. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Computing production performance metrics using actual production data. Apply standard formulas for OEE, throughput, yield, cycle time, and schedule adherence to quantify manufacturing performance against established targets.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
calculate:
  object: Production Performance Measures
  actor: ProductionPerformanceAnalyst
  result: CalculateOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| calculateActivity | Calculate production performance measures per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for calculate production performance measures |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core performance tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for calculate production performance measures |
| processExecuted | Core performance tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |

const client = calculateProductionPerformanceMeasures()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
