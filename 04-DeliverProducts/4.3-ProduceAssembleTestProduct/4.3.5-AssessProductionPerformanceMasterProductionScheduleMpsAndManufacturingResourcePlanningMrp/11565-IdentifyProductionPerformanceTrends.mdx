# Identify production performance trends

> Business-as-Code definition for identify production performance trends. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Analyzing production performance data over time to detect patterns, shifts, and trends. Use statistical methods and visualization tools to identify improving or deteriorating performance trajectories before they become critical.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyActivity | Identify production performance trends per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for identify production performance trends |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core performance tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for identify production performance trends |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyProductionPerformanceTrends } from '@headlessly/identify-production-performance-trends'

const client = identifyProductionPerformanceTrends()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
