# Develop action plan to improve performance

> Business-as-Code definition for develop action plan to improve performance. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Formulating specific, measurable plans to address identified production performance gaps. Define corrective actions, assign accountability, set target dates, and establish success criteria for each improvement initiative.

## Usage

```typescript
import { developActionPlanToImprovePerformance } from '@headlessly/develop-action-plan-to-improve-performance'

const client = developActionPlanToImprovePerformance()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
