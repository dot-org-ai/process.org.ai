# Identify issues/problems with performance

> Business-as-Code definition for identify issues/problems with performance. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Detecting and diagnosing specific problems or underperformance in production operations. Compare actual versus target metrics to pinpoint areas of concern, then investigate root causes to determine whether issues are systemic or isolated.

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: Issues/problems With Performance
  actor: ProductionPerformanceAnalyst
  result: IdentifyOutcome
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyActivity | Identify issues/problems with performance per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for identify issues/problems with performance |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core performance tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for identify issues/problems with performance |
| processExecuted | Core performance tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of identify issues/problems with performance activities |
| getProductionRecords | Query production records for a specific batch, lot, or period |
| findDeviations | Identify deviations from standard operating procedures |
| getPerformanceMetrics | Query performance metrics for performance activities |

| First Pass Yield | Percentage of products passing quality on first attempt | % |
| Production Cycle Time | Average time to complete identify issues/problems with performance | Hours |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyIssues/problemsWithPerformance } from '@headlessly/identify-issuesproblems-with-performance'

const client = identifyIssues/problemsWithPerformance()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
