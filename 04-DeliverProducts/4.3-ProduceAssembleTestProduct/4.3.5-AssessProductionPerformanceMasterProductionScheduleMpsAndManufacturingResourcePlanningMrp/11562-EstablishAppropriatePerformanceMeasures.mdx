# Establish appropriate performance measures

> Business-as-Code definition for establish appropriate performance measures. Models the performance activities within manufacturing to ensure efficient and compliant production operations.

## Overview

Identifying and defining the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure production effectiveness. Select metrics that accurately reflect manufacturing efficiency, quality output, schedule adherence, and resource utilization to enable data-driven decision-making.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| establishActivity | Establish appropriate performance measures per established procedures |
| reviewInputs | Assess required inputs and prerequisites for establish appropriate performance measures |
| executeProcess | Carry out the core performance tasks following standard operating procedures |
| documentResults | Record outcomes, observations, and any deviations from standard |
| reportStatus | Communicate status and results to supervisors and downstream teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| inputsReviewed | Inputs and prerequisites assessed for establish appropriate performance measures |
| processExecuted | Core performance tasks completed per standard procedures |
| resultsDocumented | Outcomes and observations recorded in production records |
| statusReported | Status and results communicated to relevant teams |
| deviationDetected | Non-standard condition identified during process execution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProductionStatus | Retrieve current status of establish appropriate performance measures activities |

## Usage

```typescript
import { establishAppropriatePerformanceMeasures } from '@headlessly/establish-appropriate-performance-measures'

const client = establishAppropriatePerformanceMeasures()

// Review inputs for production activity
const inputs = await client.reviewInputs({
  productionOrderId: 'PO-2025-0847',
  checkMaterials: true,
  checkEquipment: true
})

// Execute the production process
const result = await client.executeProcess({
  inputsId: inputs.id,
  standardProcedure: 'SOP-PERF-001'
})
```
