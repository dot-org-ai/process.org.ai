# Maintain business information feeds and repositories

> Business-as-Code definition for managing and maintaining the data feeds, pipelines, and repositories that store, process, and deliver business information across the enterprise.

## Overview

Maintain information feedstock along with IT hardware and software needed for storage, access, and retrieval of business information.

## Usage

```typescript
import { maintainBusinessInformationFeedsAndRepositories } from '@headlessly/maintain-business-information-feeds-and-repositories'

const repos = maintainBusinessInformationFeedsAndRepositories()

// Check feed health
const feedStatus = await repos.getFeedStatus({
  feedGroup: 'customer-data',
  includeMetrics: true
})

// Archive aged data
await repos.archiveData({
  repository: 'transaction-history',
  olderThan: '2024-01-01',
  targetTier: 'cold-storage'
})
```
