# Monitor and control business information

> Business-as-Code definition for continuously monitoring and controlling business information attributes, ensuring data flows conform to organizational rules, standards, and quality thresholds.

## Overview

Defining the rules, diction, and logic that make up the framework of the organization's information architecture. Monitoring and controlling information attributes that flow through the IT framework.

import { monitorAndControlBusinessInformation } from '@headlessly/monitor-and-control-business-information'

const monitor = monitorAndControlBusinessInformation()

// Define validation rules
await monitor.defineRules({
  domain: 'Order Processing',
  rules: [
    { field: 'orderTotal', type: 'range', min: 0, max: 1000000 },
    { field: 'customerId', type: 'referential-integrity', reference: 'customer-master' }
  ]
})

// Check for anomalies
const anomalies = await monitor.findAnomalies({
  domain: 'Order Processing',
  severity: 'high',
  since: '2025-07-01'
})
```
