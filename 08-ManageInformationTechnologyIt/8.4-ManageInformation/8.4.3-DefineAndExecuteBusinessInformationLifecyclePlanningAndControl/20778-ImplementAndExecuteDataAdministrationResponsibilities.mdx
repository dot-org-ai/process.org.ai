## Usage

```typescript
import { implementAndExecuteDataAdministrationResponsibilities } from '@headlessly/implement-and-execute-data-administration-responsibilities'

const admin = implementAndExecuteDataAdministrationResponsibilities()

// Monitor database performance
const performance = await admin.monitorPerformance({
  database: 'enterprise-warehouse',
  metrics: ['query-latency', 'throughput', 'storage-utilization']
})

// Validate data quality
const quality = await admin.validateQuality({
  dataset: 'customer-master',
  rules: ['completeness', 'uniqueness', 'referential-integrity']
})
```
