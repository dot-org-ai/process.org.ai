# Maintain and evolve enterprise data and information architecture

> Business-as-Code definition for continuously updating and improving the enterprise data and information architecture to reflect evolving business needs, technology changes, and regulatory requirements.

## Overview

Creating and maintaining the process of designing, creating, deploying, and managing strategies to maintain enterprise data and information architecture.

## Process Hierarchy

    A --> B[Establish data ownership and stewardship responsibilities]
    A --> C[Maintain and evolve enterprise data and information architecture]
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
maintain:
  object: Enterprise Data And Information Architecture
  actor: DataArchitect
  result: ArchitectureRevision
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessArchitecture | Evaluate the current architecture against business needs and technology trends |
| identifyImprovements | Document opportunities to improve the information architecture |
| planEvolution | Create a roadmap for architecture evolution and migration |
| implementChanges | Execute approved architecture changes and updates |
| versionArchitecture | Publish a new version of the enterprise information architecture |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| architectureAssessed | Current architecture evaluated for gaps and opportunities |
| improvementsIdentified | Architecture improvement opportunities documented |
| evolutionPlanned | Architecture evolution roadmap created |
| changesImplemented | Architecture changes executed and validated |
| architectureVersioned | New architecture version published |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getArchitectureVersions | List architecture versions with change summaries |
| getEvolutionRoadmap | Retrieve the planned architecture evolution roadmap |
| findImprovements | List identified improvement opportunities by priority |

## Usage

```typescript
import { maintainAndEvolveEnterpriseDataAndInformationArchitecture } from '@headlessly/maintain-and-evolve-enterprise-data-and-information-architecture'

const architecture = maintainAndEvolveEnterpriseDataAndInformationArchitecture()

// Assess current architecture
const assessment = await architecture.assessArchitecture({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  evaluationCriteria: ['scalability', 'compliance', 'integration']
})

// Plan evolution
const roadmap = await architecture.planEvolution({
  improvements: assessment.improvements,
  budget: 250000,
  timeline: '2025-H2'
})
```
