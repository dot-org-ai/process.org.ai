```

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: External Data Sources
  actor: DataEngineer
  result: ExternalDataSourceCatalog
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| discoverSources | Scan the market for relevant external data providers and feeds |
| evaluateReliability | Assess the reliability, uptime, and data freshness of each source |
| assessSecurity | Evaluate security posture and data protection practices of the provider |
| documentSources | Catalog external data sources with metadata and integration details |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| sourcesDiscovered | External data sources identified and cataloged |
| reliabilityEvaluated | Source reliability and data freshness assessed |
| securityAssessed | Provider security posture and data protection evaluated |
| sourcesDocumented | External data source catalog updated |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findExternalSources | List external data sources by category, provider, or reliability score |
| getSourceDetails | Retrieve detailed evaluation for a specific external source |
| getSecurityAssessments | Get security assessments for external data providers |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyAndUnderstandExternalDataSources } from '@headlessly/identify-and-understand-external-data-sources'

const sources = identifyAndUnderstandExternalDataSources()

// Discover external data sources
const discovered = await sources.discoverSources({
  category: 'Market Data',
  industry: 'Financial Services'
})

// Evaluate reliability
const evaluation = await sources.evaluateReliability({
  sourceId: discovered[0].id,
  criteria: ['uptime', 'freshness', 'accuracy']
})
```
