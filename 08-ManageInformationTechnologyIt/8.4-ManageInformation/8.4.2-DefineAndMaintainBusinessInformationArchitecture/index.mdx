# Define and maintain business information architecture

> Business-as-Code definition for designing, documenting, and evolving the enterprise information architecture, including data models, ownership structures, and external data source integration.

## Overview

Creating strategies to manage the organization's information and content. Outline the architecture for information collection and communication. Administer information resources, data management and content.

  domain: 'Customer',
  type: 'logical',
  entities: ['Customer', 'Account', 'Contact', 'Address'],
  version: '2.1'
})

// Assign data ownership
await infoArch.assignOwnership({
