# Define and create deployment procedure workflow

> Business-as-Code definition for designing and documenting the step-by-step procedures and automated workflows that govern how IT solutions move from staging to production environments.

## Overview

Outlining processes, methods, and equipment for deployment of IT solutions. Manage core operations servers like subversion server, production server, and development server, to make the IT services and solutions available for internal/client use.

const workflow = defineAndCreateDeploymentProcedureWorkflow()

// Find workflows for a specific application
const workflows = await workflow.findDeploymentWorkflows({
  application: 'payment-gateway',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Get runbook for emergency deployment
const runbook = await workflow.getRunbook({
  scenario: 'hotfix-production',
  application: 'payment-gateway'
})
```
