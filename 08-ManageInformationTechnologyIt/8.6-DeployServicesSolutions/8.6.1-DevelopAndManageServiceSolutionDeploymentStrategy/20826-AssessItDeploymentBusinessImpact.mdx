# Assess IT deployment business impact

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating the operational, financial, and organizational effects of IT deployments on business performance and end-user productivity.

## Overview

Evaluate the impact of IT deployment (products/services) on the business. Compare pre and post development performance, behavior of resources, and cost to assess organizational benefit.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyAffectedProcesses | Map business processes and user groups impacted by the deployment |
| measureBaselinePerformance | Capture pre-deployment metrics for comparison against post-deployment results |
| evaluateOperationalDisruption | Assess the expected downtime and workflow disruptions during deployment |
| quantifyBusinessValue | Calculate the projected ROI, cost savings, and productivity gains |
| assessRiskExposure | Identify deployment risks including data loss, service degradation, and compliance gaps |
| compileImpactReport | Consolidate findings into a formal business impact assessment document |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| affectedProcessesIdentified | Business processes and user groups impacted by deployment mapped |
| baselinePerformanceMeasured | Pre-deployment performance metrics captured |

const impact = assessItDeploymentBusinessImpact()

// Identify affected business processes
const affected = await impact.getAffectedProcesses({
  deploymentId: 'erp-upgrade-v4.2',
  includeIndirect: true
})

// Retrieve baseline metrics for comparison
const baseline = await impact.getBaselineMetrics({
  serviceId: 'order-management-system',
  metricTypes: ['latency', 'throughput', 'errorRate']
})
