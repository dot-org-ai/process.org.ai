# Develop and manage service/solution deployment strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing and governing the deployment strategy for IT services and solutions, including impact assessment, policy definition, workflow creation, change standards, approval chains, and outcome analysis.

## Overview

Creating and implementing a strategy for the deployment of IT service/solution. Define all of the activities that make the IT function available for use. Establish the change policies for IT services and solutions. Define the deployment process, procedures, and tools. Select the most feasible and practical methodologies for the deployment process.
