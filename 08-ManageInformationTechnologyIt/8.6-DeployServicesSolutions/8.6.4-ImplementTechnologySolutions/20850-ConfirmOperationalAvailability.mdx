# Confirm operational availability

> Business-as-Code definition for validating that IT services and supporting operational processes are ready and available for production use following a deployment or change implementation.

## Overview

Confirm if operational activities of IT services could be performed.

  object: Operational Availability
  actor: OperationsReadinessManager
  result: AvailabilityConfirmation
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| validateSupportReadiness | Confirm that support teams, runbooks, and escalation paths are in place |
| verifyMonitoringCoverage | Ensure monitoring, alerting, and dashboards are configured for the deployed service |
| confirmBackupRecovery | Validate that backup and recovery procedures are operational for the new deployment |
| testFailoverMechanisms | Execute failover tests to confirm high-availability configurations |
| issueAvailabilityClearance | Formally certify that the service is operationally available for users |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| supportReadinessValidated | Support teams and escalation paths confirmed as ready |
| monitoringCoverageVerified | Monitoring and alerting configured and operational |
| backupRecoveryConfirmed | Backup and recovery procedures validated |
| failoverMechanismsTested | Failover configurations tested and verified |
| availabilityClearanceIssued | Service formally certified as operationally available |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

```typescript
import { confirmOperationalAvailability } from '@headlessly/confirm-operational-availability'

const availability = confirmOperationalAvailability()

// Check availability status for a deployment
const status = await availability.getAvailabilityStatus({
  deploymentId: 'dep-2024-1103',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Get readiness checklist
const checklist = await availability.getReadinessChecklist({
  deploymentId: 'dep-2024-1103',
  filter: 'incomplete'
})
```
