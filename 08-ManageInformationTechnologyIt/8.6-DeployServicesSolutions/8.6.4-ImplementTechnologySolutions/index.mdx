# Implement technology solutions

> Business-as-Code definition for executing the technical implementation of IT solutions, including operational readiness confirmation, software installation, post-installation testing, network-wide distribution, verification, and rollback execution.

## Overview

Deploy the identified solutions for information technology important for healthy business operations. Confirm status and operational availability of IT resources. Perform testing and distribution of change. Execute roll-back protocol if necessary.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| confirmReadiness | Verify hardware and software operational status before deployment |
| executeImplementation | Carry out the IT implementation plan in the target environment |
| installRelease | Deploy the software change or release to production systems |
| testPostInstallation | Run post-installation tests to validate deployment success |
| distributeNetworkWide | Push software components across the enterprise network |
| verifySuccess | Confirm the change or release meets expected outcomes |
| executeRollback | Revert to the previous operating state if implementation fails |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| readinessConfirmed | Hardware and software operational status verified |

## Usage

```typescript
import { implementTechnologySolutions } from '@headlessly/implement-technology-solutions'

const impl = implementTechnologySolutions()

// Confirm readiness
const ready = await impl.confirmReadiness({
  serviceId: 'svc-analytics-platform',
  environment: 'production',
  checks: ['disk-space', 'network', 'dependencies', 'backup']
})

// Execute the implementation
const result = await impl.executeImplementation({
  planId: 'impl-2025-0722',
  changeId: 'CHG-2025-1045',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Verify success
const verification = await impl.verifySuccess({
  implementationId: result.id,
  healthChecks: ['api-response', 'data-integrity', 'performance']
})
