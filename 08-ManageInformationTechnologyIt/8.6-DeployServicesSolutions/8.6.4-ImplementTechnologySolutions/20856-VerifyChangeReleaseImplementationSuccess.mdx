const verification = verifyChangeReleaseImplementationSuccess()

// Get verification status
const status = await verification.getVerificationStatus({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Compare performance against SLAs
const perfVsSla = await verification.getPerformanceVsSLA({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  metrics: ['availability', 'responseTime', 'errorRate']
})
```
