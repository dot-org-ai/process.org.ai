# Confirm hardware/software operational status

> Business-as-Code definition for verifying that all hardware and software components are functioning within expected operational parameters prior to and during deployment activities.

## Overview

Confirm if hardware/software are operating as per the expectation.

## Usage

```typescript
import { confirmHardwareSoftwareOperationalStatus } from '@headlessly/confirm-hardware-software-operational-status'

const statusCheck = confirmHardwareSoftwareOperationalStatus()

// Get operational status for deployment environment
const status = await statusCheck.getOperationalStatus({
  environment: 'production',
  componentType: ['server', 'database', 'loadbalancer']
})

// Retrieve diagnostic results
const diagnostics = await statusCheck.getDiagnosticResults({
  environment: 'production',
  status: 'failed'
})
```
