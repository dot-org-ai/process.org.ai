# Implement software change/release

> Business-as-Code definition for executing software change and release deployments according to the approved schedule, including code promotion, configuration updates, and database schema changes.

## Overview

Executing changes in software and services as per change/release schedule.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
implement:
  object: Software Change/release
  actor: ReleaseEngineer
  result: DeploymentRecord
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| prepareDeploymentArtifacts | Stage build artifacts, configuration files, and database migration scripts |
| executeCodePromotion | Promote application code through deployment pipeline to target environment |
| applyConfigurationChanges | Update environment-specific configurations, feature flags, and connection strings |
| runDatabaseMigrations | Execute database schema changes and data transformations |
| validateDeploymentIntegrity | Verify deployed artifacts match expected checksums and versions |
| enableTrafficRouting | Switch traffic routing to the newly deployed software version |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| deploymentArtifactsPrepared | Build artifacts and scripts staged for deployment |
| codePromotionExecuted | Application code promoted to target environment |
| configurationChangesApplied | Environment configurations updated |
| databaseMigrationsCompleted | Schema changes and data transformations executed |
| deploymentIntegrityValidated | Deployed artifacts verified for correctness |
| trafficRoutingEnabled | Traffic switched to the new software version |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getDeploymentStatus | Retrieve deployment status for a release by environment or component |
| getDeploymentArtifacts | List staged artifacts and their versions for a release |
| getMigrationHistory | Access database migration history for a specific deployment |
| getDeploymentDiff | Compare deployed configuration against previous version |

## Usage

```typescript
import { implementSoftwareChangeRelease } from '@headlessly/implement-software-change-release'

const deployment = implementSoftwareChangeRelease()

// Check deployment status
const status = await deployment.getDeploymentStatus({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Get deployment artifacts
const artifacts = await deployment.getDeploymentArtifacts({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  type: 'application'
})
```
