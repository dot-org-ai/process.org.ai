# Deploy services/solutions

> Business-as-Code definition for the controlled deployment of IT services and solutions, encompassing strategy, implementation planning, change control, rollout, and post-deployment verification.

## Overview

Executing IT services/solutions by creating a strategy for deployment. Plan and execute the changes. Plan and administer the release of its IT services and solutions.

  targetEnvironment: 'production',
  scheduledDate: '2025-06-15T02:00:00Z',
  rollbackPlan: true
})

// Execute the deployment
const result = await deployment.executeDeployment({
  planId: plan.id,
  approvalId: 'cab-2025-0612'
})

// Validate deployment success
const validation = await deployment.validateDeployment({
  deploymentId: result.id,
  testSuite: 'smoke-tests'
})
