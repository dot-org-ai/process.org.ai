# Manage IT roll-back procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing and maintaining roll-back procedures that enable a safe return to the previous stable state when IT deployments encounter critical failures.

## Overview

Managing procedures to return to initial pre-deployment stage or previous state from current environment.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineRollbackCriteria | Establish measurable trigger conditions that initiate a roll-back decision |
| documentRollbackSteps | Create step-by-step procedures for reverting each component to its prior state |
| captureBaselineSnapshot | Record the pre-deployment baseline state of all affected systems and data |
| validateRollbackProcedure | Test the roll-back procedure in a staging environment before production deployment |
| maintainRollbackReadiness | Keep roll-back artifacts, scripts, and snapshots current and accessible |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| rollbackCriteriaDefined | Trigger conditions for roll-back established and documented |
| rollbackStepsDocumented | Step-by-step reversion procedures created and reviewed |
| baselineSnapshotCaptured | Pre-deployment system and data baselines recorded |
| rollbackProcedureValidated | Roll-back procedure tested and confirmed in staging |
| rollbackReadinessMaintained | Roll-back artifacts and scripts verified as current |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageItRollBackProcedures } from '@headlessly/manage-it-roll-back-procedures'

const rollback = manageItRollBackProcedures()

// Retrieve roll-back plan for a release
const plans = await rollback.getRollbackPlans({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  environment: 'production'
})

// Access baseline snapshots
const snapshots = await rollback.getBaselineSnapshots({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  component: 'order-processing-service'
})
```
