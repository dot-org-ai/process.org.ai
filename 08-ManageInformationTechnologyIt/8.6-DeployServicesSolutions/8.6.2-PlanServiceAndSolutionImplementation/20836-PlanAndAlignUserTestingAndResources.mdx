import { planAndAlignUserTestingAndResources } from '@headlessly/plan-and-align-user-testing-and-resources'

const testPlanning = planAndAlignUserTestingAndResources()

// Retrieve UAT plan for a release
const testPlan = await testPlanning.getTestPlan({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  phase: 'uat',
  businessArea: 'finance'
})

// List allocated testing resources
const resources = await testPlanning.getTestResources({
  releaseId: 'rel-2024-q4-003',
  resourceType: 'testers'
})
