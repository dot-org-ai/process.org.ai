# Plan service and solution implementation

> Business-as-Code definition for planning the implementation of IT services and solutions, including risk assessment, scheduling, requirements gathering, user testing, training development, stakeholder communication, and rollback procedures.

## Overview

Strategizing and executing changes in IT solutions and services. Create a plan for deploying the changes. Communicate with stakeholders about the changes. Administer and implement the changes. Train the resources who will be affected by these changes. Install changes and verify their effect.

const implementation = planServiceAndSolutionImplementation()

// Assess deployment risk
const risk = await implementation.assessRisk({
  serviceId: 'svc-erp-upgrade',
  deploymentType: 'major-release',
  affectedSystems: ['finance', 'procurement', 'inventory']
})

// Define the implementation schedule
const schedule = await implementation.defineSchedule({
  serviceId: 'svc-erp-upgrade',
  phases: ['pilot', 'regional', 'global'],
  startDate: '2025-07-01',
  maintenanceWindow: 'Sunday 00:00-06:00 UTC'
})

// Develop training materials
await implementation.developTraining({
  serviceId: 'svc-erp-upgrade',
