# Manage change deployment control

> Business-as-Code definition for governing the change and release control process for IT deployments, including impact assessment, compliance verification, risk evaluation, change consolidation, scheduling, approval, and outcome documentation.

## Overview

Creating and deploying an architecture for securing the changes deployed in the organization. Create and develop protocols that ensure proper and efficient use of deployed IT services and solutions. Test, evaluate, and implement the policies and protocols.

const changeControl = manageChangeDeploymentControl()

// Assess change impact
const impact = await changeControl.assessChangeImpact({
  changeId: 'CHG-2025-1045',
  affectedServices: ['svc-email', 'svc-directory'],
  estimatedDowntime: '15 minutes'
})

// Approve the change
const approval = await changeControl.approveChange({
  changeId: 'CHG-2025-1045',
  board: 'weekly-cab',
  conditions: ['off-peak-window', 'rollback-tested']
})

// Document the outcome
await changeControl.documentOutcome({
  changeId: 'CHG-2025-1045',
  result: 'successful',
