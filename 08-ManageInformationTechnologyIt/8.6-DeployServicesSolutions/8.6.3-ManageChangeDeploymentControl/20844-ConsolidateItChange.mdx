# Consolidate IT change

> Business-as-Code definition for bundling and integrating multiple IT changes into coordinated release packages to optimize resource utilization, minimize downtime, and reduce deployment overhead.

## Overview

Integrate all forms of changes in IT in order to make more efficient use of resources and down time, and optimizing results.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
consolidate:
  object: IT Change
  actor: ReleaseCoordinator
  result: ConsolidatedReleasePlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| inventoryPendingChanges | Catalog all pending change requests eligible for consolidation |
| analyzeChangeDependencies | Map interdependencies between pending changes to identify bundling opportunities |
| groupChangesIntoReleases | Bundle compatible changes into coordinated release packages |
| optimizeDeploymentSequence | Order grouped changes to minimize downtime and resource conflicts |
| validateConsolidatedPackage | Verify the consolidated release package for compatibility and completeness |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| pendingChangesInventoried | All pending change requests cataloged for consolidation |
| changeDependenciesAnalyzed | Interdependencies between changes mapped |
| changesGroupedIntoReleases | Compatible changes bundled into release packages |
| deploymentSequenceOptimized | Change ordering optimized for minimal disruption |
| consolidatedPackageValidated | Release package verified for compatibility |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getPendingChanges | Retrieve pending changes eligible for consolidation by date, priority, or system |
| getConsolidatedReleases | List consolidated release packages with included changes |
| getChangeDependencies | Get dependency map between changes within a release |
| getConflictingChanges | Identify changes that cannot be bundled together |

## Usage

```typescript
import { consolidateItChange } from '@headlessly/consolidate-it-change'

const consolidation = consolidateItChange()

// Get pending changes eligible for consolidation
const pending = await consolidation.getPendingChanges({
  targetDate: '2024-11-15',
  priority: ['high', 'medium'],
  system: 'order-management'
})

// Retrieve consolidated release packages
const releases = await consolidation.getConsolidatedReleases({
  releaseWindow: '2024-Q4',
  status: 'validated'
})
```
