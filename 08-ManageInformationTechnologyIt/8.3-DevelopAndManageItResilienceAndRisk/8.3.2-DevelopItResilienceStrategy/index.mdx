# Develop IT resilience strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for IT resilience strategy development. Models the process of determining IT delivery resiliency, identifying critical risks, prioritizing threats, and establishing mitigation approaches.

## Overview

Developing resilience strategies of IT across the organization so that prospective risks can be avoided.

  includeSupplyChain: true
})

// Establish mitigation approaches
const mitigations = await resilience.establishMitigationApproaches({
  riskLevel: 'critical',
  targetRTO: '4-hours',
  targetRPO: '1-hour'
})
