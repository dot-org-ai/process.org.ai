# Manage IT user identity and authorization

> Business-as-Code definition for IT user identity and authorization management. Models the process of integrating identity policies, managing user directories, administering authentication and authorization, conducting security audits, and responding to breaches.

## Overview

The process of identifying, authenticating, and authorizing IT users to have access to applications, systems, IT components, or networks by associating user rights and restrictions with established identities.
