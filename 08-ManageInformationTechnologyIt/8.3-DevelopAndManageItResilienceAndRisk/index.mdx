# Develop and manage IT resilience and risk

> Business-as-Code definition for IT resilience and risk management. Models the complete lifecycle of IT risk identification, compliance governance, security management, business continuity, and identity authorization.

## Overview

Develop and include the processes required to rapidly adapt and respond to any internal or external opportunity, demand, disruption, or threat to IT. Develop a more dynamic, strategic, and integrated approach to managing risk and compliance obligations.
