# Respond to unplanned operational issues

> Business-as-Code definition for responding to unplanned operational issues such as system outages, performance degradation, and infrastructure failures through rapid detection, diagnosis, and resolution.

## Overview

Addressing to an issue in operational activities within the IT function, that occur outside of normal routine or preventative maintenance.

import { respondToUnplannedOperationalIssues } from '@headlessly/respond-to-unplanned-operational-issues'

const incidentResponse = respondToUnplannedOperationalIssues()

// Get active incidents
const incidents = await incidentResponse.getActiveIncidents({
  severity: 'critical',
  status: 'in-progress'
})

// Get post-incident reviews
const reviews = await incidentResponse.getPostIncidentReviews({
  period: 'last-quarter',
  actionStatus: 'overdue'
})
```
