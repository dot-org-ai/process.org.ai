# Operate and monitor online systems

> Business-as-Code definition for online systems operations and monitoring. Models the continuous supervision, health checking, performance measurement, and incident detection of production IT systems and services.

## Overview

Operating online systems and defining methodologies for assessing, measuring, and monitoring their performance against expected service levels. This process encompasses real-time surveillance of application and infrastructure health, automated alerting when thresholds are breached, trend analysis to detect degradation before it impacts users, and proactive capacity management to maintain system availability. It ensures that all production systems meet their defined service level objectives and that operations teams can respond rapidly to anomalies.

## Usage

```typescript
import { operateAndMonitorOnlineSystems } from '@headlessly/operate-and-monitor-online-systems'

const operations = operateAndMonitorOnlineSystems()

// Monitor system health
const status = await operations.monitorSystemHealth({
  systems: ['crm-prod', 'erp-prod', 'web-frontend'],
  metrics: ['availability', 'response-time', 'error-rate']
})

// Configure alert thresholds
await operations.configureAlerts({
  system: 'crm-prod',
  rules: [
    { metric: 'response-time', threshold: 2000, unit: 'ms', severity: 'warning' },
    { metric: 'error-rate', threshold: 5, unit: 'percent', severity: 'critical' }
  ]
})

// Analyze performance trends
const trends = await operations.analyzePerformanceTrends({
  system: 'erp-prod',
  period: '30-days',
  granularity: 'hourly'
})
```
