# Manage IT infrastructure/data recovery

> Business-as-Code definition for managing IT infrastructure and data recovery procedures to restore systems and data following disasters, outages, or data loss events using backups, failover, and continuity plans.

## Overview

Managing resources of IT infrastructure and their recovery capacity. Manage storage, computer hardware, software, and infrastructure resources that can be stored as inventory or provided by the organization as needed. Managing backup/recovery for IT services and solutions. Use a backup system or application.

const recovery = manageItInfrastructureDataRecovery()

// Get recovery status
const status = await recovery.getRecoveryStatus({
  system: 'primary-database',
  type: 'data-restoration'
})

// Check backup availability
const backups = await recovery.getBackupAvailability({
  system: 'production-app-server',
  dateRange: { start: '2024-12-01', end: '2024-12-15' }
})
```
