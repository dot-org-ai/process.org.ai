# Manage service delivery workloads

> Business-as-Code definition for managing IT service delivery workloads by monitoring, distributing, and optimizing processing demands across infrastructure to maintain service performance and availability.

## Overview

Analyze and manage workload needs in relation to service delivery. Plan resources and mechanism around those workload needs so that services could be delivered smoothly.

    A --> C[Manage service delivery workloads]
    A --> D[Manage infrastructure performance and capacity]
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
manage:
  object: Service Delivery Workloads
  actor: WorkloadManager
  result: WorkloadManagementReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| monitorWorkloadLevels | Track real-time processing demand and queue depths across service delivery systems |
| distributeWorkloads | Route processing requests to available resources using load balancing strategies |
| throttleExcessiveDemand | Apply rate limiting and queuing when demand exceeds available capacity |
| prioritizeServiceWorkloads | Assign processing priority based on service criticality and business impact |
| reportWorkloadMetrics | Produce workload distribution and performance reports for operations management |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| workloadLevelsMonitored | Processing demand and queue depths tracked in real time |
| workloadsDistributed | Processing requests routed using load balancing |
| excessiveDemandThrottled | Rate limiting applied when demand exceeds capacity |
| serviceWorkloadsPrioritized | Processing priorities assigned by criticality |
| workloadMetricsReported | Distribution and performance reports produced |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getWorkloadMetrics | Retrieve current workload levels and distribution across systems |
| getQueueDepths | Access processing queue depths and wait times by service |
| getWorkloadHistory | Get historical workload patterns for capacity trending |

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageServiceDeliveryWorkloads } from '@headlessly/manage-service-delivery-workloads'

const workloads = manageServiceDeliveryWorkloads()

// Get workload metrics
const metrics = await workloads.getWorkloadMetrics({
  system: 'api-gateway',
  period: 'last-1-hour'
})

// Get queue depths
const queues = await workloads.getQueueDepths({
  service: 'order-processing',
  status: 'active'
})
```
