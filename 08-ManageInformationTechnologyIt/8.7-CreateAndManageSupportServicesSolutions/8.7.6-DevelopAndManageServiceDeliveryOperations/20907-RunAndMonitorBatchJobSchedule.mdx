# Run and monitor batch job schedule

> Business-as-Code definition for executing and monitoring automated batch job schedules in the production environment, ensuring jobs complete successfully within defined windows and triggering alerts for failures.

## Overview

Operate and monitor the application of scheduling batch jobs to be run in the background at a certain date and time.

  actor: BatchOperationsEngineer
  result: BatchExecutionReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| initiateBatchJobs | Start scheduled batch jobs according to the approved execution calendar |
| monitorJobExecution | Track real-time progress, resource consumption, and completion status of running jobs |
| handleJobFailures | Detect failed jobs, execute retry logic, and escalate persistent failures |
| validateJobOutputs | Verify batch job outputs for completeness and data integrity |
| logExecutionMetrics | Record job execution times, resource usage, and success/failure statistics |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| batchJobsInitiated | Scheduled batch jobs started per execution calendar |
| jobExecutionMonitored | Real-time progress and resource consumption tracked |
| jobFailuresHandled | Failed jobs detected and retry or escalation executed |
| jobOutputsValidated | Batch outputs verified for completeness and integrity |
| executionMetricsLogged | Execution times and statistics recorded |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getBatchJobStatus | Retrieve real-time status of running and completed batch jobs |
| getJobExecutionHistory | Access historical execution metrics for specific batch jobs |

import { runAndMonitorBatchJobSchedule } from '@headlessly/run-and-monitor-batch-job-schedule'

const batchOps = runAndMonitorBatchJobSchedule()

// Get batch job status
const status = await batchOps.getBatchJobStatus({
  window: 'overnight',
  status: 'running'
})

// Get failed jobs
const failures = await batchOps.getFailedJobs({
  date: '2024-12-01',
  retryStatus: 'exhausted'
})
```
