# Monitor IT infrastructure security

> Business-as-Code definition for monitoring IT infrastructure security by detecting threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access attempts through continuous surveillance of network, system, and application security events.

## Overview

Identifying, examining, and recognizing any flaw or breach in security of IT infrastructure. Ensure that protocols and guidelines for individual IT components are being followed and there is no misuse of information and breach of individual or organizational privacy.

## Usage

```typescript
import { monitorItInfrastructureSecurity } from '@headlessly/monitor-it-infrastructure-security'

const securityMonitor = monitorItInfrastructureSecurity()

// Get security alerts
const alerts = await securityMonitor.getSecurityAlerts({
  severity: 'high',
  source: 'firewall',
  status: 'open'
})

// Get security posture
const posture = await securityMonitor.getSecurityPosture({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'current-month'
})
```
