# Manage infrastructure performance and capacity

> Business-as-Code definition for managing IT infrastructure performance and capacity by monitoring resource utilization, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring infrastructure meets current and projected service demands.

## Overview

Managing the performance and capacity of infrastructure by using key performance indicators to routinely track the performance and capacity levels. Review performance. Evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the infrastructure.

  component: 'database-cluster',
  metric: 'responseTime'
})

// Get capacity forecasts
const forecast = await perfCapacity.getCapacityForecasts({
  resource: 'storage',
  horizon: '6-months'
})
