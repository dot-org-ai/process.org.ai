# Install/configure/upgrade infrastructure components

> Business-as-Code definition for installing, configuring, and upgrading IT infrastructure components including servers, network devices, storage systems, and cloud resources to meet evolving business needs.

## Overview

Installing/configuring/upgrading all the components required for operational activities within IT infrastructure. Ensure that all components of an IT infrastructure are functioning properly and updated to latest version/technology.

const deployment = installConfigureUpgradeInfrastructureComponents()

// Get deployment queue
const queue = await deployment.getDeploymentQueue({
  type: 'new-installation',
  priority: 'high'
})

// Get configuration baselines
const baselines = await deployment.getConfigurationBaselines({
  componentType: 'linux-server',
  version: 'current'
})
```
