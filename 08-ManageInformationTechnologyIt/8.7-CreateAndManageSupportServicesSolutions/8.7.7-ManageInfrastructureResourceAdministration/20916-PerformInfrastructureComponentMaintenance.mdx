# Perform infrastructure component maintenance

> Business-as-Code definition for performing scheduled and preventive maintenance on IT infrastructure components to ensure reliability, extend asset lifecycle, and minimize unplanned downtime.

## Overview

Evaluating and maintaining all aspects of infrastructure component maintenance. Ensure that all components of an IT infrastructure are functioning properly as per the expectation. Maintenance includes all preventative, routine, and corrective measures.

  dateRange: { start: '2024-12-01', end: '2024-12-31' }
})

// Get patch compliance
const compliance = await maintenance.getPatchComplianceStatus({
  environment: 'production',
  patchLevel: 'critical'
})
```
