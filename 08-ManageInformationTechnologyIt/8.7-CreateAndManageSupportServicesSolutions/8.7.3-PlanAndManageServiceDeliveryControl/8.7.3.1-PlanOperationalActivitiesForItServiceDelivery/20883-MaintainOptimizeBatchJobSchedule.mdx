# Maintain/optimize batch job schedule

> Business-as-Code definition for maintaining and optimizing automated batch job schedules to ensure timely execution of recurring data processing, reporting, and system maintenance tasks with minimal resource contention.

## Overview

Maintaining and scheduling batch jobs to run in the background at a certain date and time.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
maintain/optimize:
  object: Batch Job Schedule
  actor: BatchScheduleAdmin
  result: OptimizedBatchSchedule
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| reviewJobDependencies | Map dependencies between batch jobs to identify sequencing requirements |
| optimizeExecutionWindows | Adjust job timing to minimize resource contention and maximize throughput |
| resolveJobConflicts | Identify and resolve conflicting job schedules that compete for shared resources |
| monitorJobPerformance | Track batch job execution times, success rates, and resource consumption |
| retireObsoleteJobs | Identify and decommission batch jobs that are no longer required |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| jobDependenciesReviewed | Batch job dependency chains mapped and validated |
| executionWindowsOptimized | Job timing adjusted to reduce contention |
| jobConflictsResolved | Conflicting job schedules identified and remediated |
| jobPerformanceMonitored | Execution times, success rates, and resource usage tracked |
| obsoleteJobsRetired | Unnecessary batch jobs decommissioned |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getBatchSchedule | Retrieve the batch job schedule filtered by time window, priority, or job group |
| getJobPerformanceHistory | Access historical execution metrics for specific batch jobs |
| getJobConflicts | List batch job scheduling conflicts and resource contention issues |

## Usage

```typescript
import { maintainOptimizeBatchJobSchedule } from '@headlessly/maintain-optimize-batch-job-schedule'

const batchSchedule = maintainOptimizeBatchJobSchedule()

// Get batch schedule
const schedule = await batchSchedule.getBatchSchedule({
  window: 'overnight',
  priority: 'critical'
})

// Get job performance history
const perf = await batchSchedule.getJobPerformanceHistory({
  jobId: 'nightly-etl-pipeline',
  period: 'last-30-days'
})
```
