# Balance operational workloads across available infrastructure components

> Business-as-Code definition for distributing and balancing operational workloads across available infrastructure components to optimize resource utilization, maintain performance, and prevent capacity bottlenecks.

## Overview

Balancing workloads of all the processes and services that are provisioned to their internal or external clients, across available components of IT infrastructure. No component should be over or under utilized with the workflow of the IT operations.

## GraphDL

```yaml

  object: Operational Workloads Across Available Infrastructure Components
  actor: WorkloadBalancingEngineer
  result: WorkloadDistributionPlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessCurrentWorkloads | Measure current workload distribution and resource utilization across infrastructure |
| identifyCapacityBottlenecks | Detect infrastructure components approaching or exceeding capacity thresholds |
| redistributeWorkloads | Move workloads between infrastructure components to balance utilization |
| configureAutoScaling | Set up automated scaling policies to handle demand fluctuations dynamically |
| validateBalancingOutcomes | Confirm workload redistribution achieved target utilization and performance levels |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| currentWorkloadsAssessed | Workload distribution and utilization measured across infrastructure |
| capacityBottlenecksIdentified | Components approaching capacity thresholds detected |
| workloadsRedistributed | Workloads moved between components to balance utilization |
| autoScalingConfigured | Automated scaling policies set up for demand fluctuations |

## Usage

```typescript
import { balanceOperationalWorkloadsAcrossAvailableInfrastructureComponents } from '@headlessly/balance-operational-workloads-across-available-infrastructure-components'

const workloadBalancer = balanceOperationalWorkloadsAcrossAvailableInfrastructureComponents()

// Get workload distribution
const distribution = await workloadBalancer.getWorkloadDistribution({
  cluster: 'production-east',
  metric: 'cpu-utilization'
})

// Get bottleneck alerts
const alerts = await workloadBalancer.getBottleneckAlerts({
  severity: 'critical',
  status: 'active'
})
```
