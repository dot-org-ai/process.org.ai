# Determine specific problem support procedures

> Business-as-Code definition for defining specific problem support procedures that guide operations teams through standardized troubleshooting workflows for known and recurring IT infrastructure issues.

## Overview

Determining process and procedure to provide support for specific IT service problems.

})

// Get runbooks
const runbooks = await procedures.getRunbooks({
  type: 'troubleshooting',
  status: 'published'
})
