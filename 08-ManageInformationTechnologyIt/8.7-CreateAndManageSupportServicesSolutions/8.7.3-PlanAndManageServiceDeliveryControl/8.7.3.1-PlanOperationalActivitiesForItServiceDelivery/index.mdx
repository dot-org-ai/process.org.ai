# Plan operational activities for IT service delivery

> Business-as-Code definition for orchestrating the scheduling, resource allocation, and procedural planning required to deliver reliable IT services across the operational environment.

## Overview

Planning different delivery services for operational activities within the IT function. Use service delivery systems to manage the IT service delivery services.

const planner = planOperationalActivitiesForItServiceDelivery()

// Review capacity forecasts for the next quarter
const forecast = await planner.getCapacityForecast({
  period: 'Q2-2025',
  infrastructureTier: 'production'
})

// Find scheduled maintenance windows
const windows = await planner.findMaintenanceWindows({
  service: 'core-banking-platform',
  dateRange: { start: '2025-04-01', end: '2025-06-30' }
})
