# Schedule change/release windows

> Business-as-Code definition for scheduling maintenance windows and change/release deployment slots that minimize service disruption while ensuring timely delivery of approved changes to production environments.

## Overview

Determine the timely change or release of IT services or support. Assign periodic release/change to IT systems or services.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyMaintenanceWindows | Determine available time slots for changes based on service usage patterns and SLAs |
| coordinateWindowRequests | Consolidate change window requests from multiple teams into a unified calendar |
| assessWindowConflicts | Evaluate scheduling conflicts between overlapping change requests and blackout periods |
| approveWindowAllocations | Finalize and approve change window assignments based on risk and priority |
| communicateWindowSchedule | Distribute the approved change window calendar to all stakeholders |

## Usage

```typescript
import { scheduleChangeReleaseWindows } from '@headlessly/schedule-change-release-windows'

const changeWindows = scheduleChangeReleaseWindows()

// Get change windows
const windows = await changeWindows.getChangeWindows({
  environment: 'production',
  dateRange: { start: '2024-12-01', end: '2024-12-31' }
})

// Check blackout periods
const blackouts = await changeWindows.getBlackoutPeriods({
  environment: 'production',
  quarter: 'Q4-2024'
})
```
