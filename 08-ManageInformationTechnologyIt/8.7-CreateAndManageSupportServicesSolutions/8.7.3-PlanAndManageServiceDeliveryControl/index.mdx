# Plan and manage service delivery control

> Business-as-Code definition for planning and managing IT service delivery control, including operational activity scheduling, resource allocation, batch job management, change windows, backup planning, and workload balancing.

## Overview

Determine and manage service delivery flow across different business functions. Understand the level of services needed by different stakeholders. Identify major service delivery touch points and criticality associated. Ensure timely communication with users.

const control = planAndManageServiceDeliveryControl()

// Schedule resources for the week
const schedule = await control.scheduleResources({
  period: '2025-07-14/2025-07-20',
  teams: ['operations', 'database-admin'],
  coverageRequired: '24x7'
})

// Balance workloads across infrastructure
await control.balanceWorkloads({
  strategy: 'round-robin',
  thresholds: { cpu: 0.75, memory: 0.80, disk: 0.85 }
})

// Get batch job status
const jobs = await control.getBatchJobStatus({
  status: 'failed',
  since: '2025-07-14'
})
