# Create and maintain IT support model

> Business-as-Code definition for creating and maintaining the IT support operating model that defines how support services are structured, staffed, and delivered across the organization.

## Overview

Design and maintaining an IT support model that defines the processes and procedures needed to support users of IT services and solutions.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createAndMaintainItSupportModel } from '@headlessly/create-and-maintain-it-support-model'

const supportModel = createAndMaintainItSupportModel()

// Get support model
const model = await supportModel.getSupportModel({
  version: 'current',
  component: 'escalation-paths'
})

// Get support processes
const processes = await supportModel.getSupportProcesses({
  category: 'incident-management'
})
```
