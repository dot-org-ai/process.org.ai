```

## GraphDL

```yaml
escalate:
  object: IT Requests
  actor: EscalationCoordinator
  result: EscalationRecord
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| evaluateEscalationCriteria | Assess whether the issue meets defined criteria for escalation to a higher tier |
| prepareEscalationPackage | Compile issue details, diagnostic data, and attempted resolutions for the receiving team |
| routeEscalation | Transfer the issue to the appropriate specialist team or management level |
| trackEscalationProgress | Monitor the escalated issue through to resolution at the higher tier |
| confirmEscalationResolution | Verify the escalated issue has been resolved and close the escalation record |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| escalationCriteriaEvaluated | Issue assessed against escalation criteria |
| escalationPackagePrepared | Issue details and diagnostic data compiled for receiving team |
| escalationRouted | Issue transferred to specialist team or management |
| escalationProgressTracked | Escalated issue monitored through to resolution |
| escalationResolutionConfirmed | Escalated issue verified as resolved |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getActiveEscalations | Retrieve currently escalated issues filtered by tier, team, or age |
| getEscalationHistory | Access escalation records for specific tickets or time periods |
| getEscalationSLAStatus | Get SLA compliance status for escalated issues by tier |

## Usage

```typescript
import { escalateItRequests } from '@headlessly/escalate-it-requests'

const escalation = escalateItRequests()

// Get active escalations
const escalated = await escalation.getActiveEscalations({
  tier: 'tier-3',
  ageGreaterThan: '24-hours'
})

// Get escalation SLA status
const sla = await escalation.getEscalationSLAStatus({
  team: 'database-specialists',
  period: 'current-month'
})
```
