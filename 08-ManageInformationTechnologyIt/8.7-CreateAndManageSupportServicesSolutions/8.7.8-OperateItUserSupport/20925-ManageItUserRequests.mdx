# Manage IT user requests

> Business-as-Code definition for IT user request management. Models the intake, tracking, fulfillment, and satisfaction measurement of IT service requests from end users across the organization.

## Overview

Creating an effective plan and structure to address and resolve requests from IT users. This process covers the full lifecycle of service requests, from initial submission through fulfillment and closure, including provisioning of hardware and software, access management, information requests, and standard changes. It establishes request catalogs, defines fulfillment workflows, monitors request queues for SLA compliance, and gathers user feedback to continuously improve the request handling experience.
