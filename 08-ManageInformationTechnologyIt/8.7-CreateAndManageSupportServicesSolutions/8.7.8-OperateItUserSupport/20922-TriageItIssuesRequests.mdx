# Triage IT issues/requests

> Business-as-Code definition for IT issue and request triage. Models the intake, categorization, prioritization, and routing of IT incidents and service requests to the appropriate support tiers and resolution teams.

## Overview

Evaluating and assigning IT issues and requests to the correct support teams based on categorization, urgency, and impact assessment. This process ensures that every incoming IT incident or service request is logged, classified by type and severity, and routed to the appropriate resolution group. Effective triage minimizes response times, prevents bottlenecks at the service desk, and ensures critical business-impacting issues receive immediate attention from the right technical specialists.
