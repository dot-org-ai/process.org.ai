# Define service support planning

> Business-as-Code definition for planning IT service support operations, including demand analysis, resource staffing, knowledge management, escalation mechanisms, vendor coordination, incident triage, and performance monitoring.

## Overview

Develop strategies and methodologies to provide service support. Examine service levels, support complexity, stakeholder requirements to offer service support.

const planning = defineServiceSupportPlanning()

// Analyze support demand
const demand = await planning.analyzeDemand({
  period: '2025-Q3',
  categories: ['hardware', 'software', 'network', 'access']
})

// Define escalation paths
await planning.defineEscalation({
  severity: 'P1',
  initialTeam: 'service-desk',
  escalationPath: ['tier-2-apps', 'tier-3-engineering', 'vendor-support'],
  timeThresholds: [15, 60, 240]
})

// Monitor performance
const metrics = await planning.getPerformanceMetrics({
  period: '2025-Q2',
  metrics: ['first-contact-resolution', 'mean-time-to-resolve', 'customer-satisfaction']
})
