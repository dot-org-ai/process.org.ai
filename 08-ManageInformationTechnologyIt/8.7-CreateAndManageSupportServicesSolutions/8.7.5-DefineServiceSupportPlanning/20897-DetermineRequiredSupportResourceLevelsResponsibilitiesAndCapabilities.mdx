# Determine required support resource levels, responsibilities, and capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for determining the required support resource levels, role responsibilities, and technical capabilities needed to meet IT service support demand and service level targets.

## Overview

Determining levels of required support resources along with their responsibilities, and capabilities to resolve IT issues. Evaluate and ensure that support resources are fulfilling their responsibilities n a timely manner.

  result: SupportResourcePlan
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| calculateStaffingLevels | Determine headcount requirements per tier based on demand forecasts and SLA targets |
| defineRoleResponsibilities | Document roles, responsibilities, and required competencies for each support position |
| assessSkillGaps | Identify gaps between current staff capabilities and required competencies |
| planCapacityBuffers | Determine contingency staffing levels for demand spikes and attrition |
| alignResourcesWithSLAs | Map resource allocations to ensure each service level target can be met |
