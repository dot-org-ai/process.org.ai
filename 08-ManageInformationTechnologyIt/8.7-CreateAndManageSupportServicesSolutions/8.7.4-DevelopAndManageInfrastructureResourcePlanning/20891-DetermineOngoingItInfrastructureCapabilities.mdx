# Determine ongoing IT infrastructure capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for assessing and documenting the ongoing capabilities of IT infrastructure, including capacity, performance, reliability, and security posture, to support infrastructure planning decisions.

## Overview

Determining existing IT infrastructure capabilities. Identify the gaps and needs in order to enhance the existing IT infrastructure to meet growth objectives.

```typescript
import { determineOngoingItInfrastructureCapabilities } from '@headlessly/determine-ongoing-it-infrastructure-capabilities'

const capabilities = determineOngoingItInfrastructureCapabilities()

// Get infrastructure inventory
const assets = await capabilities.getInfrastructureInventory({
  type: 'compute',
  location: 'us-east-1'
})

// Get capacity projections
const projections = await capabilities.getCapacityProjections({
  component: 'storage-cluster-primary',
  horizon: '12-months'
})
```
