```typescript
import { createAndMaintainItServiceDeliveryModel } from '@headlessly/create-and-maintain-it-service-delivery-model'

const deliveryModel = createAndMaintainItServiceDeliveryModel()

// Get current delivery model
const model = await deliveryModel.getDeliveryModel({
  version: 'current',
  component: 'operating-model'
})

// Get performance metrics
const performance = await deliveryModel.getModelPerformance({
  period: 'last-quarter',
  metric: 'processCompliance'
})
```
