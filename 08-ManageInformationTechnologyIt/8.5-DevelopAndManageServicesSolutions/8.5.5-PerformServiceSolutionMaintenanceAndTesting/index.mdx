# Perform service/solution maintenance and testing

> Business-as-Code definition for performing preventative, routine, and corrective maintenance on IT services and solutions, including remediation assessment, design modification, operations management, and enhanced packaging.

## Overview

Engaging in all aspects of service/solution maintenance and testing includes all preventative, routine, and corrective activates. Ensure that IT service/solution are functioning properly and regulations where applicable.

| assessRemediation | Evaluate reported issues and determine the scope of remediation |
| modifyDesign | Update the service design to address defects or enhancements |
| executeRemediation | Apply patches, fixes, and corrective changes to the service |
| manageOperations | Monitor and manage ongoing service operations |
| packageEnhancement | Bundle fixes and enhancements into a maintenance release |
| regressionTest | Execute regression tests to verify maintenance changes |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| remediationAssessed | Issue evaluation and remediation scope determined |
| designModified | Service design updated to address maintenance needs |
| remediationExecuted | Patches and corrective changes applied successfully |
| operationsManaged | Service operations monitoring cycle completed |
| enhancementPackaged | Maintenance release bundled and ready for deployment |
| regressionTested | Regression testing completed for maintenance changes |

## Searches

| Search | Description |

## Usage

```typescript
import { performServiceSolutionMaintenanceAndTesting } from '@headlessly/perform-service-solution-maintenance-and-testing'

const maintenance = performServiceSolutionMaintenanceAndTesting()

// Assess remediation for a reported issue
const assessment = await maintenance.assessRemediation({
  serviceId: 'svc-billing-engine',
  issueId: 'INC-2025-0847',
  severity: 'critical'
})

// Execute the remediation
await maintenance.executeRemediation({
  assessmentId: assessment.id,
  changeType: 'hotfix',
  branch: 'hotfix/billing-calc-fix'
})

// Run regression tests
const results = await maintenance.regressionTest({
  serviceId: 'svc-billing-engine',
  testSuite: 'billing-regression'
})
```
