# Perform IT service/solution remediation

> Business-as-Code definition for executing corrective actions on IT services and solutions, including defect resolution, patch application, configuration adjustments, and validation of remediation effectiveness.

## Overview

Administering the efforts and activities for IT service/solution remediation. This process element requires the organization to create plans for corrective action in collaboration with government agencies and pertinent professional services agencies which specialize in remediation efforts relevant to the organization's service/solution. Additionally, the organization needs to consult experts to validate the plan, determine resources allocation, resolve any legal concerns, and formulate a company-wide policy for IT service/solution remediation.

  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  priority: 'critical',
  status: 'in-progress'
})

// Track remediation progress
const progress = await remediation.getRemediationProgress({
  planId: plans[0].id
})
```
