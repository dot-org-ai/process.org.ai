# Assess IT remediation

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating IT service and solution defects, determining the scope and urgency of remediation efforts, and recommending corrective action plans to restore or enhance service functionality.

## Overview

Evaluate plans to address information technology environmental adulteration for rectification efforts.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyDefects | Catalog reported defects, failures, and performance degradations requiring remediation |
| classifySeverity | Assign severity and priority ratings based on business impact and urgency |
| analyzeRootCause | Investigate underlying causes of the defect or service degradation |
| estimateRemediationEffort | Determine the resources, timeline, and cost required for remediation |
| recommendCorrectiveAction | Propose remediation approaches ranked by effectiveness and feasibility |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| defectsIdentified | Reported defects cataloged and documented |
| severityClassified | Severity and priority ratings assigned to defects |
| rootCauseAnalyzed | Root cause investigation completed with findings |
| remediationEffortEstimated | Resource, timeline, and cost estimates prepared |
| correctiveActionRecommended | Remediation approaches proposed and ranked |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getDefectsByService | Retrieve reported defects filtered by service, severity, or status |
| getRootCauseAnalysis | Get root cause analysis findings for a specific defect |
| getRemediationEstimates | Retrieve effort and cost estimates for pending remediations |

## Usage

```typescript
import { assessItRemediation } from '@headlessly/assess-it-remediation'

const assessment = assessItRemediation()

// Get defects by service
const defects = await assessment.getDefectsByService({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  severity: 'high',
  status: 'open'
})

// Get root cause analysis
const rootCause = await assessment.getRootCauseAnalysis({
  defectId: defects[0].id
})
```
