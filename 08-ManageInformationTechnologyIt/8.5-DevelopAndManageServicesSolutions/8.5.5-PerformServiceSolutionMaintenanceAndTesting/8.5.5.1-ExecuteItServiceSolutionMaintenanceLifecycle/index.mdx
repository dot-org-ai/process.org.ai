# Execute IT service/solution maintenance lifecycle

> Business-as-Code definition for managing the end-to-end maintenance lifecycle of IT services and solutions, from defect assessment and remediation through design modification, operational management, and repackaging of fixed or enhanced deliverables.

## Overview

Executing IT service/solution maintenance lifecycle in order to reduce maintenance costs and increase reliability of IT infrastructure concerning service/solution related problems.

## Usage

```typescript
import { executeItServiceSolutionMaintenanceLifecycle } from '@headlessly/execute-it-service-solution-maintenance-lifecycle'

const maintenance = executeItServiceSolutionMaintenanceLifecycle()

// Get active maintenance requests
const requests = await maintenance.getMaintenanceRequests({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  severity: 'critical',
  status: 'open'
})

// Check remediation status
const status = await maintenance.getRemediationStatus({
  requestId: requests[0].id
})
```
