# Identify opportunities for IT component reuse

> Business-as-Code definition for systematically discovering and evaluating opportunities to reuse existing IT components across projects and services, reducing duplication and accelerating delivery.

## Overview

Identification of opportunities for reusing IT components so that they can be cost-effective and efficient.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: Opportunities For IT Component Reuse
  actor: ReuseAnalyst
  result: ReuseOpportunityReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| analyzeExistingComponents | Review the current component inventory for reuse candidates |
| matchComponentsToNeeds | Compare existing components against new project requirements |
| assessReuseReadiness | Evaluate component adaptability, documentation, and maintainability for reuse |
| quantifyCostSavings | Calculate cost and time savings from reusing components versus building new |
| recommendReuse | Present reuse recommendations with supporting analysis to project teams |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| existingComponentsAnalyzed | Current component inventory reviewed for reuse potential |
| componentsMatchedToNeeds | Existing components compared against new requirements |
| reuseReadinessAssessed | Component reuse readiness evaluation completed |
| costSavingsQuantified | Reuse cost and time savings calculated |
| reuseRecommended | Reuse recommendations presented to project teams |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findReuseOpportunities | List reuse opportunities filtered by project, component type, or savings |
| getReuseReadinessScore | Retrieve the reuse readiness assessment for a specific component |
| getCostSavingsReport | Get the projected cost savings from component reuse |

| Cost Savings from Reuse | Total cost savings achieved through component reuse | Currency |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyOpportunitiesForItComponentReuse } from '@headlessly/identify-opportunities-for-it-component-reuse'

const reuse = identifyOpportunitiesForItComponentReuse()

// Find reuse opportunities for a new project
const opportunities = await reuse.findReuseOpportunities({
  project: 'new-crm-integration',
  minSavingsPercentage: 20
})

// Check reuse readiness of a specific component
const readiness = await reuse.getReuseReadinessScore({
  componentId: 'shared-notification-service',
  targetProject: 'new-crm-integration'
})
```
