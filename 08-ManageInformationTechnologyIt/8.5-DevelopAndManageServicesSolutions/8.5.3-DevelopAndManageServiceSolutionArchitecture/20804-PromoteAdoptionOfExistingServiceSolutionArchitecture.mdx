# Promote adoption of existing service/solution architecture

> Business-as-Code definition for driving organizational awareness and adoption of established service and solution architecture patterns, standards, and reference implementations across development teams.

## Overview

Encouraging acceptance of existing IT service/solution architecture in the organization.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
promote:
  object: Adoption Of Existing Service/solution Architecture
  actor: ArchitectureAdvocate
  result: AdoptionReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| communicateArchitecture | Present existing architecture patterns and standards to development teams |
| createReferenceImplementations | Build reference implementations that demonstrate architecture best practices |
| conductArchitectureWorkshops | Deliver training workshops on architecture patterns and adoption |
| measureAdoption | Track architecture adoption rates across projects and teams |
| addressAdoptionBarriers | Identify and resolve obstacles preventing architecture adoption |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| architectureCommunicated | Architecture patterns and standards presented to teams |
| referenceImplementationsCreated | Reference implementations built and published |
| workshopsConducted | Architecture training workshops delivered |
| adoptionMeasured | Architecture adoption metrics collected and analyzed |
| adoptionBarriersAddressed | Obstacles to adoption identified and resolved |

## Searches

|-----|-------------|------|
| Architecture Adoption Rate | Percentage of new projects following established architecture patterns | % |
| Workshop Attendance | Number of developers attending architecture workshops per quarter | Count |
| Reference Implementation Usage | Number of projects leveraging reference implementations | Count |

## Usage

```typescript
import { promoteAdoptionOfExistingServiceSolutionArchitecture } from '@headlessly/promote-adoption-of-existing-service-solution-architecture'

const adoption = promoteAdoptionOfExistingServiceSolutionArchitecture()

// Check adoption metrics
const metrics = await adoption.getAdoptionMetrics({
  pattern: 'microservices',
  period: 'last-quarter',
  groupBy: 'team'
})

// Get reference implementations
const references = await adoption.getReferenceImplementations({
  pattern: 'event-driven-architecture',
  technology: 'typescript'
})
```
