# Develop and manage service/solution architecture

> Business-as-Code definition for creating and governing IT service and solution architectures, including constraint assessment, integration planning, component reuse optimization, conformance reviews, and exception management.

## Overview

Creating the architecture for the IT services and solutions. Assess architecture and business constraints in order to understand integration requirements. Promote existing architecture. Manage exceptions.

const architecture = developAndManageServiceSolutionArchitecture()

// Assess constraints for a new service
const constraints = await architecture.assessConstraints({
  serviceId: 'svc-payment-gateway',
  evaluationScope: ['infrastructure', 'business', 'security']
})

// Design the architecture
const blueprint = await architecture.designArchitecture({
  serviceId: 'svc-payment-gateway',
  pattern: 'event-driven-microservices',
  constraints: constraints.id
})

// Review conformance
const conformance = await architecture.reviewConformance({
  architectureId: blueprint.id,
  standardsVersion: '3.2'
})
```
