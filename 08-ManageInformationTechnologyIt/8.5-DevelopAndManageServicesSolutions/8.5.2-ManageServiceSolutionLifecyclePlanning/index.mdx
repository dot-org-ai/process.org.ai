# Manage service/solution lifecycle planning

> Business-as-Code definition for planning and managing the full lifecycle of IT services and solutions, from technology capability scouting through solution identification, approach determination, and sunset planning.

## Overview

Executing life-cycle planning for IT services and solutions. Develop new requirements and feature-function enhancements. Create and design a life cycle plan that addresses the current and future state of IT services and solutions.

const lifecycle = manageServiceSolutionLifecyclePlanning()

// Scout emerging technologies
const radar = await lifecycle.scoutTechnology({
  domains: ['AI/ML', 'Edge Computing', 'Serverless'],
  evaluationCriteria: ['maturity', 'cost', 'risk']
})

// Define service lifecycle
const plan = await lifecycle.defineLifecycle({
  serviceId: 'svc-legacy-crm',
  stages: ['Pilot', 'Growth', 'Maturity', 'Decline', 'Sunset'],
  currentStage: 'Decline'
})

// Plan sunset
await lifecycle.planSunset({
