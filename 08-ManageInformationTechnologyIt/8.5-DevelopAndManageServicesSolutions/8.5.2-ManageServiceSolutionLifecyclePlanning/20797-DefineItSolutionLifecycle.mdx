# Define IT solution lifecycle

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing the end-to-end lifecycle phases, milestones, and governance checkpoints for IT solutions from inception through retirement.

## Overview

Defining solutions to satisfy business needs. IT solution lifecycle provides a means to address the full life cycle of an information technology solution and addresses the current and future state of IT services and solutions.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: IT Solution Lifecycle
  actor: LifecycleManager
  result: SolutionLifecycleDefinition
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineLifecyclePhases | Establish the phases of the solution lifecycle from conception to retirement |
| setMilestones | Define key milestones and deliverables for each lifecycle phase |
| establishGovernanceGates | Create governance checkpoints and approval criteria between phases |
| mapRolesAndResponsibilities | Assign roles and responsibilities for each lifecycle phase |
| documentLifecyclePolicy | Publish the solution lifecycle framework as an organizational standard |

## Events

|-------|-------------|
| lifecyclePhasesDefined | Solution lifecycle phases established |
| milestonesSet | Key milestones and deliverables defined for each phase |
| governanceGatesEstablished | Governance checkpoints created between lifecycle phases |
| rolesAndResponsibilitiesMapped | Roles assigned for each lifecycle phase |
| lifecyclePolicyDocumented | Solution lifecycle framework published as standard |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getLifecycleDefinition | Retrieve the solution lifecycle definition with phases and milestones |
| getGovernanceGates | List governance gate criteria by lifecycle phase |
| getSolutionLifecycleStatus | Get the current lifecycle phase and status of a specific solution |

| Lifecycle Phase Duration Accuracy | Deviation between planned and actual phase durations | % |

## Usage

```typescript
import { defineItSolutionLifecycle } from '@headlessly/define-it-solution-lifecycle'

const lifecycle = defineItSolutionLifecycle()

// Get lifecycle definition
const definition = await lifecycle.getLifecycleDefinition({
  solutionType: 'cloud-native-application'
})

// Check solution lifecycle status
const status = await lifecycle.getSolutionLifecycleStatus({
  solutionId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  includeUpcomingMilestones: true
})
```
