# Determine IT service/solution approach

> Business-as-Code definition for selecting the optimal delivery approach for IT services and solutions, balancing business alignment, cost control, and delivery efficiency across build, buy, and hybrid options.

## Overview

Determining an approach to create a base for delivering IT service/solution aligned with overall business needs while maintaining a tight control on delivery and costs.

const approach = determineItServiceSolutionApproach()

// Analyze delivery options
const options = await approach.analyzeDeliveryOptions({
  service: 'customer-portal',
  models: ['build-internal', 'buy-saas', 'hybrid'],
  constraints: { budget: 500000, timeline: '6-months' }
})

// Select the recommended approach
const selected = await approach.selectApproach({
  serviceId: 'customer-portal',
  selectedModel: options.recommended,
  rationale: 'Best balance of cost and time-to-market'
})
```
