# Create service/solution design

> Business-as-Code definition for formulating the technical and functional design of an IT service or solution, translating validated requirements into a structured architecture and implementation blueprint.

## Overview

Formulating a design for service/solution that helps an organization to meet its objectives. Develop a new framework for molding the service/solution processes into a coherent and structured form.

  object: Service/solution Design
  actor: SolutionDesigner
  result: DesignSpecification
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| createHighLevelDesign | Develop the overall solution architecture and component interaction model |
| createDetailedDesign | Produce detailed technical designs for each component including data models and APIs |
| designUserExperience | Define user interface layouts, workflows, and interaction patterns |
| reviewDesign | Conduct design reviews with architecture and development stakeholders |
| approveDesign | Obtain formal approval for the design specification before development begins |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| highLevelDesignCreated | Overall solution architecture and component model developed |
| detailedDesignCreated | Detailed technical designs for components produced |
| userExperienceDesigned | User interface and interaction patterns defined |

  version: 'latest',
  status: 'approved'
})

// Review design traceability
const traceability = await design.getDesignTraceability({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  includeGaps: true
})
