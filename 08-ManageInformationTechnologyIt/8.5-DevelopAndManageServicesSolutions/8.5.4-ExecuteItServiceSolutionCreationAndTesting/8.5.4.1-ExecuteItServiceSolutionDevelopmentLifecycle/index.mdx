# Execute IT service/solution development lifecycle

> Business-as-Code definition for managing the end-to-end execution of the IT service and solution development lifecycle, from requirements validation through design, build, integration, testing, and deployment packaging.

## Overview

Executing an information system, aiming to produce a high quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within time and cost estimates, and is inexpensive to maintain and cost-effective to enhance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { executeItServiceSolutionDevelopmentLifecycle } from '@headlessly/execute-it-service-solution-development-lifecycle'

const lifecycle = executeItServiceSolutionDevelopmentLifecycle()

// Check lifecycle status
const status = await lifecycle.getLifecycleStatus({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  includePhaseDetails: true
})

// Get quality gate results
const gates = await lifecycle.getQualityGateResults({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  phase: 'integration-testing'
})
```
