# Bundle service/solution deployment packaging

> Business-as-Code definition for assembling validated service and solution artifacts into deployment-ready packages, including release notes, configuration scripts, and installation procedures.

## Overview

Creating and implementing a strategy for the deployment of IT service/solution by defining all of the activities that make the IT function available for use. Define the deployment process, procedures, and tools. Select the most feasible and practical methodologies for the deployment process.

## GraphDL

```yaml
bundle:
  object: Service/solution Deployment Packaging
  actor: ReleaseEngineer
  result: DeploymentPackage
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assembleArtifacts | Gather all validated build artifacts, configurations, and dependencies |
| createInstallationScripts | Develop installation, configuration, and migration scripts |
| generateReleaseNotes | Document changes, new features, bug fixes, and known issues |
| packageRelease | Bundle all artifacts and documentation into a deployment-ready package |
| verifyPackage | Run smoke tests on the deployment package to confirm integrity |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| artifactsAssembled | All validated build artifacts gathered |
| installationScriptsCreated | Installation and configuration scripts developed |
| releaseNotesGenerated | Release documentation completed |
| releasePackaged | Deployment-ready package bundled |
| packageVerified | Deployment package integrity confirmed through smoke tests |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getDeploymentPackages | Retrieve deployment packages filtered by service, version, or status |
| getReleaseNotes | Get release notes for a specific package version |
| getPackageArtifacts | List all artifacts included in a deployment package |

const packaging = bundleServiceSolutionDeploymentPackaging()

// Get deployment packages
const packages = await packaging.getDeploymentPackages({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  status: 'verified'
})

// Get release notes
const notes = await packaging.getReleaseNotes({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  version: '2.0.0'
})
```
