# Assess and validate IT service/solution requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for systematically evaluating and validating the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements for IT services and solutions to ensure completeness, feasibility, and alignment with business needs.

## Overview

Evaluating and validating the requirements and needs of IT service/solution.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
assess:
  object: And Validate IT Service/solution Requirements
  actor: RequirementsAnalyst
  result: ValidatedRequirementsDocument
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| gatherRequirements | Collect functional, non-functional, and technical requirements from stakeholders |
| analyzeRequirements | Evaluate requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility |
| validateWithStakeholders | Review requirements with business stakeholders to confirm accuracy |
| prioritizeRequirements | Rank requirements by business value, risk, and implementation complexity |
| baselineRequirements | Approve and baseline the validated requirements for development |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| requirementsGathered | Requirements collected from all stakeholder groups |
| requirementsAnalyzed | Requirements evaluated for completeness and feasibility |
| requirementsValidated | Requirements confirmed with business stakeholders |
| requirementsPrioritized | Requirements ranked by value and complexity |
| requirementsBaselined | Validated requirements approved and baselined |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getRequirements | Retrieve requirements filtered by service, priority, or status |
| getValidationStatus | Get the validation status and outstanding issues for requirements |
| getRequirementsTraceability | Retrieve traceability matrix linking requirements to design and tests |

## Usage

```typescript
import { assessAndValidateItServiceSolutionRequirements } from '@headlessly/assess-and-validate-it-service-solution-requirements'

const requirements = assessAndValidateItServiceSolutionRequirements()

// Get validated requirements
const validated = await requirements.getRequirements({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  status: 'baselined',
  priority: 'high'
})

// Check traceability
const traceability = await requirements.getRequirementsTraceability({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  includeTestCoverage: true
})
```
