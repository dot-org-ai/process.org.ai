# Integrate IT components and services

> Business-as-Code definition for combining individually built and tested IT components into a unified service, verifying that components interact correctly and the integrated solution meets integration requirements.

## Overview

Combining the newly built IT component along with IT services in order to gain optimum output.

## GraphDL

```yaml
integrate:
  object: IT Components And Services
  actor: IntegrationEngineer
  result: IntegratedServiceBuild
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assembleComponents | Combine individual components into an integrated service build |
| configureIntegrations | Set up connections, data flows, and messaging between components |
| executeIntegrationTests | Run integration test suites to verify component interactions |
| resolveIntegrationIssues | Debug and fix issues discovered during integration testing |
| certifyIntegration | Confirm the integrated build meets integration acceptance criteria |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| componentsAssembled | Individual components combined into an integrated build |
| integrationsConfigured | Component connections and data flows configured |
| integrationTestsExecuted | Integration test suites completed |
| integrationIssuesResolved | Integration defects debugged and fixed |
| integrationCertified | Integrated build certified as meeting acceptance criteria |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getIntegrationStatus | Retrieve the current integration status for a service build |
| getIntegrationTestResults | List integration test results by component pair or test suite |
| getIntegrationIssues | Retrieve outstanding integration issues by severity or component |

## Usage

```typescript
import { integrateItComponentsAndServices } from '@headlessly/integrate-it-components-and-services'

const integration = integrateItComponentsAndServices()

// Check integration status
const status = await integration.getIntegrationStatus({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  buildNumber: 42
})

// Get integration test results
const results = await integration.getIntegrationTestResults({
  serviceId: 'customer-analytics-platform',
  suite: 'api-contract-tests'
})
```
