# Execute IT service/solution creation and testing

> Business-as-Code definition for executing the creation and testing of IT services and solutions, covering the full development lifecycle from requirements validation through design, build, integration, testing, and deployment packaging.

## Overview

Understanding customer requirements. Design the IT services and solutions based on the requirements. Develop components for providing the requirements. Train resources to provide support. Test the IT services and solutions in advance. Confirm the customer experience post-sale.

const creation = executeItServiceSolutionCreationAndTesting()

// Validate requirements
const requirements = await creation.validateRequirements({
  serviceId: 'svc-invoice-processor',
  stakeholders: ['finance-team', 'product-owner'],
  acceptanceCriteria: ['batch-processing', 'pdf-generation', 'email-delivery']
})

// Build components
const build = await creation.buildComponents({
  requirementsId: requirements.id,
  targetBranch: 'release/v2.1'
})

// Execute validation testing
const results = await creation.executeValidation({
  buildId: build.id,
