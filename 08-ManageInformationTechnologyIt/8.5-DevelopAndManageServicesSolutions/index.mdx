# Develop and manage services/solutions

> Business-as-Code definition for the end-to-end lifecycle of IT service and solution development, from strategy and architecture through creation, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

## Overview

Designing and maintaining the IT services/solutions catalogue. Evaluate the performance of IT services/solutions. Communicate the results to the management.

const services = developAndManageServicesSolutions()

// Define a new service strategy
const strategy = await services.defineServiceStrategy({
  domain: 'Customer Portal',
  businessObjective: 'Self-service account management',
  targetRelease: '2025-Q3'
})

// Design the architecture
const architecture = await services.designArchitecture({
  strategyId: strategy.id,
  pattern: 'microservices',
  integrations: ['CRM', 'Billing', 'Identity']
})

// Retrieve lifecycle status
const status = await services.getLifecycleStatus({
  serviceId: architecture.serviceId
})
```
