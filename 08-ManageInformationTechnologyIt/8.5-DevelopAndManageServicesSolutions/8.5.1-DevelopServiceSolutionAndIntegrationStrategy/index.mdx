# Develop service/solution and integration strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for establishing the strategic framework for IT service and solution development, including development methodologies, reusable component selection, integration standards, and governance.

## Overview

Developing service/solution along with creating a strategy that provides a base for delivering service/solution aligned with overall business needs. Conduct research within the services/solutions field for development and integration.

  businessUnit: 'Digital Commerce',
  horizon: '12 months'
})

// Evaluate reusable components
const components = await strategy.evaluateComponents({
  category: 'Authentication',
  minMaturity: 'production-ready'
})

// Review standards exceptions
const exceptions = await strategy.getExceptions({
  status: 'pending',
