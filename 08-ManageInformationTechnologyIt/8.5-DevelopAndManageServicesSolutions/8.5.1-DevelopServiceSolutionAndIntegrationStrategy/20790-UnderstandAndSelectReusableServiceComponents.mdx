# Understand and select reusable service components

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying, evaluating, and selecting reusable IT service components from internal libraries, open-source repositories, and vendor catalogs to accelerate development and reduce duplication.

## Overview

Understanding and selecting reusable service components so that they can be cost-effective and efficient.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
understand:
  object: And Select Reusable Service Components
  actor: ComponentLibrarian
  result: ComponentSelectionReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| inventoryComponents | Catalog available reusable components from internal and external sources |
| evaluateFitness | Assess candidate components against established selection criteria |
| analyzeReusePotential | Determine the reuse potential and adaptability of candidate components |
| selectComponents | Choose components that best meet requirements for cost, quality, and fit |
| documentSelection | Record selection rationale, dependencies, and integration notes |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| componentsInventoried | Available reusable components cataloged |
| fitnessEvaluated | Component fitness assessment completed against criteria |
| reusePotentialAnalyzed | Reuse potential and adaptability analysis completed |
| componentsSelected | Reusable components selected for adoption |
| selectionDocumented | Component selection rationale and integration notes recorded |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findComponents | Search for reusable components by capability, technology, or domain |
| getComponentDetails | Retrieve detailed information about a specific reusable component |
| getSelectionHistory | List past component selection decisions with rationale |

## Usage

```typescript
import { understandAndSelectReusableServiceComponents } from '@headlessly/understand-and-select-reusable-service-components'

const components = understandAndSelectReusableServiceComponents()

// Search for reusable components
const results = await components.findComponents({
  capability: 'payment-processing',
  technology: 'typescript',
  minReliability: 99.5
})

// Evaluate fitness against criteria
const evaluation = await components.evaluateFitness({
  componentId: results[0].id,
  criteriaSet: 'production-readiness',
  projectContext: 'checkout-service'
})
```
