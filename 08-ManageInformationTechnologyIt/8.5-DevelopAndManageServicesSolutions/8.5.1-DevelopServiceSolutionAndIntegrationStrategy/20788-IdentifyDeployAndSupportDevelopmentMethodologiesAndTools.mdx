# Identify, deploy, and support development methodologies and tools

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating, deploying, and providing ongoing support for development methodologies (Agile, DevOps, Waterfall) and toolchains that enable efficient IT service and solution creation.

## Overview

Identifying and implementing techniques and tools for development based on overall value addition to the IT environment.

const devTools = identifyDeployAndSupportDevelopmentMethodologiesAndTools()

// Get approved tool catalog
const catalog = await devTools.getToolCatalog({
  category: 'ci-cd',
  status: 'approved'
})

// Check tool usage metrics
const metrics = await devTools.getToolUsageMetrics({
  tool: 'github-actions',
  period: 'last-quarter',
  groupBy: 'team'
})
```
