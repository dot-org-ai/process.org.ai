# Determine IT service/solution development

> Business-as-Code definition for evaluating and determining the optimal approach for IT service and solution development, including build-versus-buy analysis and cost-effectiveness assessments.

## Overview

Determining the development of IT service/solution. Analyze the pros and cons of IT service/solution and it's methods on the basis of their cost effectiveness and development value.

const development = determineItServiceSolutionDevelopment()

// Assess feasibility of a new service
const feasibility = await development.assessFeasibility({
  serviceName: 'Customer Analytics Platform',
  capabilities: ['real-time-dashboards', 'predictive-models', 'data-integration'],
  targetTimeline: 'Q3-2026'
})

// Run build-versus-buy analysis
const analysis = await development.analyzeBuildVsBuy({
  serviceName: 'Customer Analytics Platform',
  vendorOptions: ['vendor-a', 'vendor-b'],
  internalCapabilities: feasibility.technicalCapabilities
})
```
