# Understand business requirements for IT capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for understanding business requirements for IT capabilities. Models the process of eliciting, documenting, and validating business requirements that drive IT capability investments.

## Overview

Understanding business requirements for the existing IT environment as well as future IT needs. This process involves engaging with business stakeholders to elicit, document, and validate the capabilities they require from IT services, both to support current operations and to enable future strategic initiatives. Requirements are gathered through structured interviews, workshops, and analysis of business process documentation, then mapped to existing IT capabilities to identify gaps and investment priorities.
