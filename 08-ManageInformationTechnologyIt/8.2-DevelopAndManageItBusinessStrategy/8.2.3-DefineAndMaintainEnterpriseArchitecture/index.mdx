# Define and maintain enterprise architecture

> Business-as-Code definition for enterprise architecture management. Models the process of creating architecture principles, establishing governance, researching innovative technologies, and providing input to IT project prioritization.

## Overview

Outlining and maintaining the organization's IT architecture. Establish the IT architecture definition and framework. Ensure the relevance of IT. Create and confirm the approach for IT maintenance. Create rules and regulations to guide IT architecture. Authenticate and finalize all IT related research and innovation that takes place within the organization.
