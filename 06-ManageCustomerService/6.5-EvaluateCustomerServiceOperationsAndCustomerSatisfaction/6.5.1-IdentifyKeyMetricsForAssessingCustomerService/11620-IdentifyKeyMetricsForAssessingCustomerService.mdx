# Identify key metrics for assessing customer service

> Business-as-Code definition for customer service metrics identification. Models the selection, definition, and establishment of key performance indicators for measuring customer service effectiveness.

## Overview

Selecting, defining, and establishing the key performance indicators used to measure customer service effectiveness. Catalog existing metrics and their measurement methods, benchmark against industry standards and best practices, choose the most impactful metrics for the customer service scorecard, define precise calculation methods and data sources, set performance targets, and obtain leadership approval for the metrics framework.
