# Investigate fraudulent claims

> Business-as-Code definition for fraudulent warranty claim investigation. Models the detection, investigation, and resolution of potentially fraudulent warranty claims.

## Overview

Detecting, investigating, and resolving potentially fraudulent warranty claims to protect the organization from financial losses and maintain program integrity. Apply automated fraud detection rules and pattern-matching algorithms to screen incoming claims for anomalies such as duplicate submissions, excessive claim frequency, altered documentation, or out-of-warranty repairs disguised as covered events. Conduct detailed investigations of flagged claims by reviewing supporting documentation, interviewing claimants and service providers, and cross-referencing repair records. Document evidence for confirmed fraud cases, recommend enforcement actions including claim denial, dealer or supplier penalties, or referral to legal counsel, and continuously refine fraud detection criteria based on investigation findings.
