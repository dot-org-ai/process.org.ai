# Track performance against customer service scorecard

> Business-as-Code definition for customer service scorecard performance tracking. Models the collection, calculation, and reporting of customer service performance against established scorecard metrics.

## Overview

Collecting, calculating, and reporting customer service performance against the established scorecard metrics. Gather raw performance data from service systems, compute scorecard metric values using defined calculations, compare actual performance against targets and thresholds, generate the periodic scorecard report, and flag metrics falling below target for corrective action review.

  object: Performance Against Customer Service Scorecard
  actor: PerformanceTrackingAnalyst
  result: PerformanceTrackingResult
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| collectPerformanceData | Gather raw data from service systems for each scorecard metric |
| calculateMetricScores | Compute scorecard values using defined calculation methods |
| compareAgainstTargets | Measure actual performance against established targets and thresholds |
| generateScorecardReport | Produce the customer service performance scorecard for the reporting period |
| flagPerformanceGaps | Identify metrics falling below target and trigger corrective action reviews |
