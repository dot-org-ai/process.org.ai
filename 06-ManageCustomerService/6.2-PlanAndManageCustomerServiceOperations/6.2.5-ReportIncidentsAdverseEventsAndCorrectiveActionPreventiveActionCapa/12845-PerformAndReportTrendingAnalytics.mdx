# Perform and report trending analytics

> Business-as-Code definition for incident trend analysis and reporting. Models the statistical analysis of incident data, pattern detection, risk signal identification, and trend reporting for proactive quality and safety management.

## Overview

Performing statistical analysis on incident and adverse event data to identify trends, emerging risk patterns, and recurring failure modes. Generate periodic trend reports that inform quality improvement initiatives, recall risk assessments, and regulatory compliance monitoring.
