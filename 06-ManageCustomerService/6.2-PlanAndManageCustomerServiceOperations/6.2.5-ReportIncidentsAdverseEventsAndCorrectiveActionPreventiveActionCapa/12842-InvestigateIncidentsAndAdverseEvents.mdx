# Investigate incidents and adverse events

> Business-as-Code definition for incident investigation and root cause analysis. Models the evidence collection, root cause determination, impact assessment, and findings documentation for product or service incidents and adverse events.

## Overview

Conducting thorough investigations of identified incidents and adverse events to determine root cause, scope of impact, and contributing factors. Gather physical evidence, interview stakeholders, review manufacturing and quality records, and perform failure analysis to support corrective action planning.
