# Resolve incidents and adverse events

> Business-as-Code definition for incident resolution and corrective action implementation. Models the planning, execution, verification, and closure of corrective actions to address the root causes of identified incidents and adverse events.

## Overview

Implementing corrective actions to address the root causes of identified incidents and adverse events. Develop action plans, assign responsibilities, execute remediation activities, verify effectiveness of corrective actions, and formally close the incident when the risk has been adequately mitigated.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| developActionPlan | Create a corrective action plan with tasks, owners, and timelines |
| implementCorrectiveAction | Execute the corrective measures to address the incident root cause |
| verifyEffectiveness | Confirm that corrective actions have effectively eliminated the root cause |
| updateProcessControls | Modify process controls and documentation to prevent recurrence |
| closeIncident | Formally close the incident record after verification of resolution |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| actionPlanDeveloped | Corrective action plan created and approved |
| correctiveActionImplemented | Corrective measures executed as planned |
| effectivenessVerified | Corrective action effectiveness confirmed through testing or monitoring |
| processControlsUpdated | Process documentation and controls modified to prevent recurrence |
| incidentClosed | Incident record formally closed after successful resolution |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getPendingActions | List corrective actions awaiting implementation by priority or deadline |
| getActionPlanStatus | Query corrective action plan progress by incident or owner |
| getVerificationResults | Retrieve effectiveness verification outcomes by incident |
| getClosedIncidents | List resolved and closed incidents by product, cause, or period |

const resolver = resolveIncidentsAndAdverseEvents()

// Develop a corrective action plan
const plan = await resolver.developActionPlan({
  incidentId: 'INC-2025-0042',
  actions: [
    { task: 'Update heat treatment parameters', owner: 'process-engineering', deadline: '2025-04-15' },
    { task: 'Implement incoming inspection for hardness', owner: 'quality', deadline: '2025-04-01' }
  ]
})

// Verify effectiveness after implementation
const verification = await resolver.verifyEffectiveness({
