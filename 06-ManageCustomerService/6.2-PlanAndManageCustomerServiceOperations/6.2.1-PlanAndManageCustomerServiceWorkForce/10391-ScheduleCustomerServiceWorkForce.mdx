# Schedule customer service work force

> Business-as-Code definition for assigning customer service agents to shifts and channels based on forecasted demand, skill requirements, and service level targets.

## Overview

Deploying the work force to manage customer service contracts. Create a systematic summary of the operations and service required, as well as the specific amount of work force that is to be deployed to the customer service operations. Ensure work force is directly proportional to the estimated forecast of customer service contracts.
