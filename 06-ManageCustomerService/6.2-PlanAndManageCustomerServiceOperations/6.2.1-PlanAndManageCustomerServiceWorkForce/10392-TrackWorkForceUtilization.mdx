# Track work force utilization

> Business-as-Code definition for monitoring and measuring the productive use of customer service agents across shifts, channels, and interaction types.

## Overview

Tracking the utilization of work force deployed for managing customer service operations. Monitor the utility of the work force deployed for managing customer service operations in order to evaluate its efficiency and cost effectiveness. Calculate the overall labor effectiveness, which measures the utility, performance, and quality of the work force.

## Usage

```typescript
import { trackWorkForceUtilization } from '@headlessly/track-work-force-utilization'

const utilization = trackWorkForceUtilization()

// Calculate occupancy rates for a team
const occupancy = await utilization.calculateOccupancyRate({
  team: 'tier-1-support',
  period: '2025-03',
  groupBy: 'agent'
})

// Identify idle time windows
const idlePeriods = await utilization.identifyIdleTime({
  threshold: 300,
  channel: 'phone',
  period: '2025-03-15'
})
```
