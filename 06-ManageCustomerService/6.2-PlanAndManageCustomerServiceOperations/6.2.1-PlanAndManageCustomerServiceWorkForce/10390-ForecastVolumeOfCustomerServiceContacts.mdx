# Forecast volume of customer service contacts

> Business-as-Code definition for projecting incoming customer service contact volumes across channels, time periods, and categories to drive workforce planning decisions.

## Overview

Projecting the total work force required to service customer service inquiries in order to effectively predict the volume of vendor contracts required. Estimate the number of the customer service contracts in an agreed-upon time frame in order to strategically maintain the work force necessitated for customer inquires. Analyze historical data around customer service contracts, the universe of customer inquiries, frequency of inquiries, servicing capability (per head) of the employees, etc.
