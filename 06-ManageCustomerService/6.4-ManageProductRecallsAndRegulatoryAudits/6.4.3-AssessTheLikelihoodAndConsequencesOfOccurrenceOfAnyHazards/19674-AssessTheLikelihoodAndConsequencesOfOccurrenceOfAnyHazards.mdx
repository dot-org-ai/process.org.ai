# Assess the likelihood and consequences of occurrence of any hazards

> Business-as-Code definition for hazard likelihood and consequence assessment. Models the systematic evaluation of product hazard probability and potential severity to inform recall decisions.

## Overview

Systematically evaluating the probability and potential severity of product hazards to inform recall decisions and risk classification. Enumerate potential harm scenarios, estimate occurrence probability using field data and engineering analysis, assess consequence severity, calculate composite risk scores, and recommend the appropriate level of response including voluntary recall, mandatory recall, or safety alert.
