# Monitor and audit recall effectiveness

> Business-as-Code definition for recall effectiveness monitoring. Models the tracking, measurement, and reporting of recall progress against completion targets.

## Overview

Tracking, measuring, and reporting recall execution progress against established completion targets. Monitor the number of affected units returned, repaired, or replaced. Calculate recall completion rates, conduct periodic effectiveness assessments, distribute progress reports to leadership and regulators, and identify barriers preventing customers from responding to the recall.
