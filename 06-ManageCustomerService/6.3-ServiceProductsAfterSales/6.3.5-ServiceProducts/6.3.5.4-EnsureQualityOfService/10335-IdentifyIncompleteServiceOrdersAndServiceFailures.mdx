# Identify incomplete service orders and service failures

> Business-as-Code definition for incomplete service order and failure identification. Models the detection, categorization, and escalation of service orders that failed to complete successfully.

## Overview

Determining orders which have not been completed or delivered. Identify the service orders that are partially or entirely incomplete, as well as the orders that have not been delivered to the customer. Use techniques such as project trackers to recognize the progress of the service orders.

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: Incomplete Service Orders And Service Failures
  actor: ServiceQualityAnalyst
  result: ServiceQualityResult
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| detectIncompleteOrders | Identify service orders that missed completion deadlines or failed quality checks |
| categorizeFailureReason | Classify the reason for service incompletion or failure |
| assessCustomerImpact | Evaluate the impact on the customer and determine remediation needs |
| escalateForResolution | Route incomplete orders to appropriate teams for corrective action |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| incompleteOrdersIdentified | Service orders not completed within SLA identified |
| serviceFailuresCategorized | Service failures classified by root cause type |
| failureEscalationTriggered | Critical service failure escalated for management review |
| remediationPlanCreated | Corrective plan developed for incomplete or failed service orders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getIncompleteOrders | List service orders not completed within their target timeframe |
| getServiceFailures | Query service failures by type, severity, or technician |
| getFailureTrends | Analyze service failure trends over time by category |
| getRemediationStatus | Track remediation progress for identified service failures |

const client = identifyIncompleteServiceOrdersAndServiceFailures()

// Identify incomplete orders and failures
const failures = await client.identifyServiceFailures({
  period: '2025-Q1',
  includeRootCause: true
})

// Create remediation plan
await client.createRemediationPlan({
  failureIds: failures.map(f => f.id),
  targetCompletionDate: '2025-05-01',
  assignee: 'service-ops-lead'
})
