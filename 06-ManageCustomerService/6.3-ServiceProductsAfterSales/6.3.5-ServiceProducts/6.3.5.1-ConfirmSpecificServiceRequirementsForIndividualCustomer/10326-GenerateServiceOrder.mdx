# Generate service order

> Business-as-Code definition for service order generation. Models the creation of formal service orders that authorize and specify the after-sales service work to be performed for a customer.

## Overview

Designing a short-term agreement between the service provider and customer. One-time services are ordered by the service recipient and resource-related billing is performed upon completion. Use the service order to document service and customer service work.
