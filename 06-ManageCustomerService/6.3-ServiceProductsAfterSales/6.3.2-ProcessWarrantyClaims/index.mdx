# Process warranty claims

> Business-as-Code definition for warranty claims processing. Models the full claim lifecycle from receipt and validation through investigation, approval, payment authorization, and reconciliation.

## Overview

Identifying, investigating, and processes warranty claims. This process includes: receipt and validation of a warranty claim; definition and diagnosis /root cause analysis of an issue and recommendation for corrective action; the determination of responsibility for settlement of the claim; the transaction being approved or denied; and the originator being notified and payment authorized. In the case of a recurring event, further investigation (definition and diagnosis or root cause analysis) is performed, and a recommendation for corrective action is made and implemented in production/design. It ends when the claim is closed.
