# Determine responsible party

> Business-as-Code definition for warranty liability assignment. Models the identification of the responsible party (manufacturer, supplier, dealer, or customer) for a warranty claim based on root cause analysis and contractual obligations.

## Overview

Identifying which party bears responsibility for the warranty issue based on investigation findings, contractual terms, and supply chain agreements. Evaluate whether the defect originated from manufacturing, supplier components, dealer handling, installation, or customer misuse to assign financial and remedial responsibility.
