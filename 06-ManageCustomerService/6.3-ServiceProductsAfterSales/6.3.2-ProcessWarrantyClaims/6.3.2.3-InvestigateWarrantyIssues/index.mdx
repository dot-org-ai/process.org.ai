# Investigate warranty issues

> Business-as-Code definition for warranty issue investigation. Models issue definition, field service scheduling, defective part retrieval, root cause analysis, and corrective action recommendation.

## Overview

Investigating warranty claims that require deeper technical analysis. Define the reported issue, dispatch field service technicians for on-site investigation, retrieve defective parts for laboratory analysis, perform root cause determination, and deliver investigation findings with corrective action recommendations.
