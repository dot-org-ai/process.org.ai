# Investigate issue/perform root cause analysis

> Business-as-Code definition for warranty root cause investigation. Models the systematic analysis of warranty defects to determine underlying causes and recommend corrective actions.

## Overview

Conducting systematic root cause analysis of warranty defects to identify the underlying cause of product failures. Plan the investigation scope and methodology, collect physical evidence including failed components and test data, apply engineering analysis methods such as fault tree analysis or fishbone diagrams, and document the confirmed root cause with supporting evidence.
