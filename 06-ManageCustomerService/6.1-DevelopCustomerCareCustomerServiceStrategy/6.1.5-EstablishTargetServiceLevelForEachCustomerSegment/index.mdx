# Establish target service level for each customer segment

> Business-as-Code definition for service level target establishment by customer segment. Models customer analysis, needs assessment, SLA design, and service level benchmarking across segments.

## Overview

Determining and implementing levels for customer services. Benchmark certain customer service practices, and base customer level services on those benchmarks. Create a service level agreement, which is a negotiated agreement designed to create a common understanding about services, priorities, and responsibilities.
