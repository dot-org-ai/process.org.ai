# Assess problem and determine work requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for analyzing legal issues, scoping work requirements, and determining whether external legal expertise is needed to address specific matters.

## Overview

Examining the problems and deciding the action requirements for engaging outside counsel. This process element calls upon the organization to internally analyze the issues for which assistance from external counsel is needed. Additionally, the organization needs to break-down the issue, identifying the tasks and exercises where outside counsel can help.
