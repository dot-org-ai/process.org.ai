# Protect intellectual property

> Business-as-Code definition for identifying, securing, managing, and enforcing intellectual property rights including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and licensing agreements.

## Overview

Safeguarding the intellectual property of the organization. This process requires the organization to protect a wide variety of intellectual property created by it. It involves creating and managing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), following up on current developments in the areas where the organization holds patents, tracking the use of the organization's copyrighted material, creating and upholding licensing terms, and administering policies for safeguarding intellectual property.
