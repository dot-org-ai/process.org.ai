# Improve/validate vehicle design

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for improve/validate vehicle design (automotive)

## Overview

The first process executed in this group is to build and evaluate the vehicle assembly in digital mock-up (DMU). The DMU is a “virtual” digital model with mathematics and evaluates the assembly of the model - i.e. does everything in the model work together as a complete mock-up of the real product? The vehicle is then evaluated/improvised in virtual space (using computer aided engineering, or CAE). Next, the designs for the assembly and shipping /transportation of the vehicle are completed, and tools are designed and built to accomplish the production activities.
