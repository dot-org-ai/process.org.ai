# Develop New Vehicles

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for develop new vehicles (automotive)

## Overview

Develop new vehicles includes the planning, design, and prototyping processes executed in the supply chain of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). It includes strategizing and planning the portfolio and processes, setting up and finalizing the business concepts for the new vehicle (vehicle synthesis), and designing/engineering the vehicle using a computer aided design (CAD) model. The vehicle design is then improved and validated, a prototype/mule is built (in 3 stages), and the vehicle’s functional requirements are validated.
