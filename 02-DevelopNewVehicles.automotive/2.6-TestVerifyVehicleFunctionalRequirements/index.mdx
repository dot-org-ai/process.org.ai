# Test/verify vehicle functional requirements

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for test/verify vehicle functional requirements (automotive)

## Overview

The final processes in developing a new vehicle relates to the verification of the vehicle’s functional requirements. Experts are often consulted to troubleshoot potential problems and to conduct extensive tests, such as track tests and simulated road and driving conditions. The prototype is then reworked, or redesigned, if necessary. The vehicle, supplier durability, and performance are tested, design changes are managed, and vehicles are prepared. Additionally, regulatory certifications are obtained and approval from senior management for final vehicle test and ride are obtained. Once the vehicle is in production, sales volume and customer satisfaction/complaints are verified, quality results are analyzed and countermeasures for market are planned.
