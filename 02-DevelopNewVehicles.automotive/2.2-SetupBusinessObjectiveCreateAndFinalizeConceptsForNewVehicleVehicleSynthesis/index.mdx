# Setup business objective (create and finalize concepts for new vehicle -Vehicle Synthesis)

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for setup business objective (create and finalize concepts for new vehicle -vehicle synthesis) (automotive)

## Overview

In “setup business objective (create and finalize concepts for new vehicle - vehicle synthesis)”, the business plan and corresponding objectives and constraints are created for the new vehicle. This includes a consideration of target sales volume, profit, and cost. Designers may be given constraints and targets for their projects. For example, the designers may be asked to build a bonnet (hood); however, they will be asked to build it to crumple in places (safety) and to build it out of low cost materials (plastics). Additionally in this stage, preliminary program specifications are approved; research and development is performed; computer aided engineering (CAE – computer software used to aid in engineering analysis tasks) is analyzed; and themes are selected, finalized, and confirmed. In the automotive industry, the use of CAE tools has enabled the reduction of product development costs and time, and has improved the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles produced. At the end of this stage, corporate quality requirements are validated, the plan for what will be manufactured in-house is made, the in-vehicle system is designed, and the program is managed.
