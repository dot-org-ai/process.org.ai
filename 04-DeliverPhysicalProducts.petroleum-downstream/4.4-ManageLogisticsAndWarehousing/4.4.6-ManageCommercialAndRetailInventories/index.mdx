# Manage commercial and retail inventories

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for manage commercial and retail inventories (petroleum-downstream)

## Overview

Handling commercial and retail inventories from a provider perspective. It begins with a forecast of end user demand, followed by a monitoring of current and forward/future positions, the reconciliation of book to physical inventory, and the monitoring of customer inventories.  From a customer (i.e. retail or commercial/industrial (C&I)) perspective, getting the fuel to a tank 9last mile) so it can be used. Tank inventory is managed.  Demand is forecast, best buy is determined, the order is placed and received and finally, reconciliation is performed.
