# Review supply, production, distribution and materials strategies

> TODO: Business-as-Code definition for review supply, production, distribution and materials strategies (petroleum-downstream)

## Overview

Creating strategies for production and materials. Handle the demand for the products/services of the organization. Develop plans for handling materials. Develop and administer the schedule for master production. Plan for distribution requirements and its constraints by reviewing and assessing distribution policies and performance and by establishing quality standards and procedures. Production processes are created and standard operating procedures defined.  Standard operating procedures are a detailed explanation of how a policy is to be implemented by providing details about how tasks should be implemented.  The details in a SOP standardize a process and provide step-by-step how-to instructions that enable anyone within the operation to perform the task in a consistent manner e.g. SOPs for start-up, shut-down of units and for changing between product grades.  Production workplace layouts and infrastructures are solidified and a support utilities strategy is defined. These support utilities (gas, electricity, steam, hydrogen, specialty gases, acids, catalysts, etc.) may be supplied by other companies or generated in-house.
