# Manage program execution

> Business-as-Code definition for program execution management. Models the coordination of constituent projects, resource management, risk mitigation, and delivery tracking across the program lifecycle.

## Overview

Administering and implementing business programs. Implement and execute programs with the intention of improving an organization's performance. Execute all the individual projects of the program to ensure the desired success.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| coordinateConstituentProjects | Synchronize schedules, dependencies, and deliverables across program projects |
| manageResourceAllocation | Allocate and balance resources across program components |
| mitigateProgramRisks | Identify, assess, and respond to risks at the program level |
| trackProgramDeliverables | Monitor progress of key deliverables across all constituent projects |
| manageProgramChanges | Evaluate and process change requests that impact program scope or timeline |

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageProgramExecution } from '@headlessly/manage-program-execution'

const execution = manageProgramExecution()

// Coordinate constituent projects
const coordination = await execution.coordinateConstituentProjects({
  programId: 'PRG-digital-transformation',
  projects: ['PRJ-crm-migration', 'PRJ-data-platform', 'PRJ-channel-integration'],
  syncDependencies: true
})

// Mitigate a program risk
const mitigation = await execution.mitigateProgramRisks({
  programId: 'PRG-digital-transformation',
  riskId: 'RISK-vendor-delay',
  response: 'activate-contingency-vendor',
  impactedProjects: ['PRJ-channel-integration']
})
```
