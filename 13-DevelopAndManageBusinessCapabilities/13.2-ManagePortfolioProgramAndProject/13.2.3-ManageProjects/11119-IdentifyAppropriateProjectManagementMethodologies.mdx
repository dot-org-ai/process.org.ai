# Identify appropriate project management methodologies

> Business-as-Code definition for project management methodology selection. Models the evaluation and selection of management approaches such as waterfall, agile, hybrid, and adaptive frameworks based on project characteristics.

## Overview

Identifying and implementing the techniques and procedures for managing business projects. Identify the most appropriate models, which are to be employed by the project managers for the purpose of designing, planning, implementing, and achieving project objectives. Examine and assess various project management methodologies such as adaptive project framework, agile development, crystal methods, and feature-driven development.

const methodologies = identifyAppropriateProjectManagementMethodologies()

// Assess project characteristics for methodology selection
const characteristics = await methodologies.assessProjectCharacteristics({
  projectId: 'PRJ-mobile-app',
  attributes: {
    size: 'medium',
    complexity: 'high',
    uncertainty: 'high',
    teamDistribution: 'co-located',
    regulatoryRequirements: 'low'
  }
})

// Select methodology based on assessment

  candidateMethodologies: ['scrum', 'kanban', 'waterfall', 'hybrid'],
  projectCharacteristics: characteristics
})
