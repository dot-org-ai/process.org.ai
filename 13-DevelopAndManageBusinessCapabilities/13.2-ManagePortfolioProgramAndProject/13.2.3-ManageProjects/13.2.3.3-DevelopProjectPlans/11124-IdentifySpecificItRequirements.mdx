# Identify specific IT requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for IT requirements identification. Models the determination of hardware, software, network, and data requirements for project delivery.

## Overview

Determining the IT requirements for specific business projects. Identify the requirements of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data related to the project. Consider factors such as functional requirements, design requirements, project phases, and project schedule.
