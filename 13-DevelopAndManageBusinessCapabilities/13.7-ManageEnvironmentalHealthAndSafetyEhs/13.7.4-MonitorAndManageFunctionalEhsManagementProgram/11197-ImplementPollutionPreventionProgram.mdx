# Implement pollution prevention program

> Business-as-Code definition for implement pollution prevention program. Models the process of implementing a program that reduces or eliminates the creation of pollutants through increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources.

## Overview

Implementing a program that reduces or eliminates the creation of pollutants through increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources. Implement a program to inspect facilities that store, manufacture, or use hazardous, toxic, or polluting materials.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyPollutionSources | Survey facilities and processes to catalog emissions, discharges, and waste streams |
| conductWasteStreamAnalysis | Analyze material flows to identify opportunities for source reduction and recycling |
| designPreventionMeasures | Engineer process modifications, substitutions, and controls to reduce pollutant generation |
| deployPreventionInfrastructure | Install pollution control equipment, monitoring systems, and containment structures |
| trainPersonnelOnPrevention | Educate facility staff on pollution prevention procedures and spill response protocols |
| auditPreventionEffectiveness | Inspect facilities and verify that implemented measures are achieving reduction targets |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| pollutionSourcesIdentified | Facility emissions, discharges, and waste streams cataloged |
| wasteStreamAnalysisCompleted | Material flow analysis finished with reduction opportunities documented |
| preventionMeasuresDesigned | Process modifications and controls designed and approved |
| preventionInfrastructureDeployed | Pollution control equipment and monitoring systems installed |
| personnelTrained | Facility staff completed pollution prevention and spill response training |
| preventionEffectivenessAudited | Audit completed verifying reduction targets are being achieved |

## Searches

const prevention = implementPollutionPreventionProgram()

// Identify pollution sources at a facility
const sources = await prevention.identifyPollutionSources({
  facilityId: 'plant-west-7',
  pollutantCategories: ['air-emissions', 'wastewater', 'solid-waste'],
  regulatoryFramework: 'EPA-RCRA'
})

// Conduct waste stream analysis
const analysis = await prevention.conductWasteStreamAnalysis({
  facilityId: 'plant-west-7',
  sourceIds: sources.map(s => s.id),
  baselineYear: 2024
})

// Audit effectiveness of deployed measures
const audit = await prevention.auditPreventionEffectiveness({
  facilityId: 'plant-west-7',
  auditType: 'semi-annual',
  reductionTarget: 0.15,
  complianceStandard: 'ISO-14001'
})
