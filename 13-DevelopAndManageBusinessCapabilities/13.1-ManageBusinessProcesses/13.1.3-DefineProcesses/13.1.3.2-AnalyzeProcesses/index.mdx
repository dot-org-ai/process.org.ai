# Analyze processes

> Business-as-Code definition for process analysis. Models the examination of business processes through modeling, gap analysis, best practice identification, and improvement opportunity assessment.

## Overview

Assessing and examining the set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. Create a business process model that captures how a business process works and how individuals from different groups work together to achieve a business goal.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
analyze:
  object: Processes
  actor: ProcessAnalyst
  result: ProcessAnalysisReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| mapCurrentState | Document the as-is process flow with inputs, outputs, and handoffs |
| identifyBottlenecks | Detect constraints and delays in process execution |
| benchmarkBestPractices | Compare current processes against published industry best practices |
| performGapAnalysis | Evaluate differences between current state and target performance |
| modelProcessVariants | Create alternative process models for scenario evaluation |
| assessAutomationPotential | Identify process steps suitable for automation or elimination |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| currentStateMapped | As-is process flow documented and validated |
| bottlenecksIdentified | Process constraints and delays cataloged with impact estimates |
| bestPracticesBenchmarked | Industry best practices compared against current processes |
| gapAnalysisCompleted | Performance gaps quantified between current and target states |
| processVariantsModeled | Alternative process designs created and evaluated |
| automationPotentialAssessed | Automation candidates identified with feasibility ratings |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProcessModels | Retrieve process models by domain, owner, or status |
| findBottlenecks | List identified bottlenecks by severity or process area |
| getBestPractices | Retrieve published best practices by industry or process type |
| getGapAnalysisResults | Retrieve gap analysis findings by process or department |

## Usage

```typescript
import { analyzeProcesses } from '@headlessly/analyze-processes'

const analysis = analyzeProcesses()

// Map current state of an order-to-cash process
const processMap = await analysis.mapCurrentState({
  processId: 'PRC-order-to-cash',
  scope: ['order-entry', 'fulfillment', 'invoicing', 'collections'],
  includeHandoffs: true
})

// Perform gap analysis against best practices
const gaps = await analysis.performGapAnalysis({
  processId: 'PRC-order-to-cash',
  benchmarkSource: 'APQC-top-quartile',
  dimensions: ['cycle-time', 'cost-per-transaction', 'error-rate']
})
```
