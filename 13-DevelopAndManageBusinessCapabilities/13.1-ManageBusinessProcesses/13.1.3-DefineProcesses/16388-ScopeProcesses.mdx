# Scope processes

> Business-as-Code definition for process scoping. Models the definition of process boundaries, inputs, outputs, and the range of activities that constitute each business process.

## Overview

Defining the extent and limits of business processes. Define the range and diversity of all the set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal.

## Process Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define processes]
    A --> B[Scope processes]
    A --> C[Analyze processes]
    A --> D[Model and document processes]
    A --> E[Publish processes]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
scope:
  object: Processes
  actor: ProcessAnalyst
  result: ProcessScopeDocument
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineBoundaries | Establish the start and end points of a business process |
| identifyInputsOutputs | Catalog the inputs consumed and outputs produced by the process |
| mapStakeholders | Identify all parties involved in or affected by the process |
| documentConstraints | Record limitations, regulations, and policies constraining the process |
| validateScope | Confirm scope completeness with process owners and stakeholders |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| boundariesDefined | Process start and end points established and documented |
| inputsOutputsIdentified | Process inputs and outputs cataloged |
| stakeholdersMapped | Process stakeholders identified and roles clarified |
| constraintsDocumented | Process constraints and regulatory boundaries recorded |
| scopeValidated | Process scope reviewed and approved by stakeholders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getProcessScope | Retrieve scope documentation for a specific process |
| findProcessesByBoundary | List processes with boundaries intersecting a given function or system |
| getProcessInputsOutputs | Retrieve inputs and outputs for a process |

## Process Flow

    C --> D[documentConstraints]
    D --> E[validateScope]

| Scope Completion Rate | Percentage of identified processes with finalized scope documents | % |
| Stakeholder Sign-Off Rate | Percentage of scope documents approved by all stakeholders | % |
| Scope Revision Frequency | Average number of scope revisions before final approval | Count |

## Usage

```typescript
import { scopeProcesses } from '@headlessly/scope-processes'

const scoping = scopeProcesses()

// Define boundaries for a procurement process
const scope = await scoping.defineBoundaries({
  processId: 'PRC-procure-to-pay',
  startEvent: 'purchase-requisition-submitted',
  endEvent: 'payment-disbursed',
  includedDepartments: ['procurement', 'accounts-payable', 'receiving']
})

// Validate scope with stakeholders
const validation = await scoping.validateScope({
  scopeId: scope.id,
  reviewers: ['procurement-manager', 'ap-supervisor', 'cfo']
})
```
