> Business-as-Code definition for business process definition. Models the complete workflow of scoping, analyzing, modeling, documenting, and publishing business processes for organizational use.

## Overview

Outlining and establishing the business processes of the organization. Scope, analyze, map, and publish processes for the employees who may require it.

    A[Define processes]
    A --> B[Scope processes]
    A --> C[Analyze processes]
    A --> D[Model and document processes]
    A --> E[Publish processes]
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
define:
  object: Processes
  actor: ProcessArchitect
  result: ProcessDefinition
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| scopeProcess | Define the boundaries, inputs, outputs, and stakeholders of a process |
| analyzeProcess | Examine process steps to identify best practices, bottlenecks, and redundancies |
| modelProcess | Create visual process models using standard notation such as BPMN |
| documentProcess | Write detailed process documentation including roles, rules, and exceptions |
| publishProcess | Release approved process definitions to the enterprise process repository |
| versionProcess | Create a new version of an existing process definition |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| processScoped | Process boundaries and scope defined and approved |
| processAnalyzed | Process analysis completed with findings documented |
| processModeled | Visual process model created and validated |
| processDocumented | Process documentation completed with all required detail |
| processPublished | Process definition released to the enterprise repository |
| processVersioned | New version of a process definition created |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findProcessDefinitions | List process definitions filtered by domain, status, or owner |
| getProcessModel | Retrieve the current BPMN or flow model for a specific process |
| getProcessVersionHistory | Retrieve the version history and changelog for a process definition |
| findUndocumentedProcesses | List processes that lack current documentation |

  inputs: ['signed-contract', 'customer-profile'],
  outputs: ['active-account', 'welcome-package']
})

// Publish the documented process
const published = await processes.publishProcess({
  processId: scope.id,
  version: '1.0',
  approvedBy: 'process-governance-board'
