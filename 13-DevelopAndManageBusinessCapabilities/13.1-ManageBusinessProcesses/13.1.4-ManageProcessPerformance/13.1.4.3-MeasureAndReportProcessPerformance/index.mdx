# Measure and report process performance

> Business-as-Code definition for process performance measurement and reporting. Models the collection, calculation, and presentation of balanced scorecard metrics across financial, customer, internal process, and learning perspectives.

## Overview

Defining and using performance indicators to consider the financial perspective, customer perspective, internal process perspective, and learning perspective of the organization.

const measurement = measureAndReportProcessPerformance()

// Collect and calculate metrics for a process
const metrics = await measurement.calculateMetrics({
  processId: 'PRC-procure-to-pay',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  perspectives: ['financial', 'customer', 'internal-process', 'learning']
})

// Generate a performance report
const report = await measurement.generatePerformanceReport({
  processId: 'PRC-procure-to-pay',
  period: '2026-Q1',
  format: 'balanced-scorecard',
  includeVisualizations: true
})
