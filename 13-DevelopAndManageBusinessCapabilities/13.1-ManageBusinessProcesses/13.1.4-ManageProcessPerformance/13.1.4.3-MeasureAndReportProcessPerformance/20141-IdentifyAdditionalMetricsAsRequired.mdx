# Identify additional metrics as required

> Business-as-Code definition for supplemental metric identification. Models the evaluation of existing performance indicators and determination of additional metrics needed to achieve business objectives.

## Overview

Determining the need for additional performance indicators that would be necessary to successfully achieve the business goal.

## Process Hierarchy

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
identify:
  object: Additional Metrics As Required
  actor: ProcessPerformanceAnalyst
  result: MetricProposal
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| reviewExistingMetrics | Assess whether current indicators adequately measure process performance |
| identifyMeasurementGaps | Detect areas where performance is not being captured by existing metrics |
| proposeNewMetrics | Define new performance indicators with calculation methods and data sources |
| validateMetricFeasibility | Confirm that proposed metrics can be reliably collected and calculated |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| existingMetricsReviewed | Current performance indicator coverage assessed |
| measurementGapsIdentified | Uncovered performance dimensions documented |
| newMetricsProposed | Additional indicators defined with specifications |
| metricFeasibilityValidated | Proposed metrics confirmed as collectible and calculable |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getMetricGaps | Retrieve identified measurement gaps by process or business goal |
| findProposedMetrics | List pending metric proposals by status or process area |
| getMetricCoverage | Retrieve metric coverage analysis for a process |

## Usage

```typescript
import { identifyAdditionalMetricsAsRequired } from '@headlessly/identify-additional-metrics-as-required'

const metricReview = identifyAdditionalMetricsAsRequired()

// Review existing metrics for a process
const gaps = await metricReview.identifyMeasurementGaps({
  processId: 'PRC-customer-onboarding',
  currentMetrics: ['time-to-onboard', 'completion-rate'],
  businessGoals: ['reduce-churn', 'increase-satisfaction']
})

// Propose new metrics
const proposal = await metricReview.proposeNewMetrics({
  processId: 'PRC-customer-onboarding',
  metrics: [
    { name: 'first-value-time', calculation: 'days-to-first-feature-use', dataSource: 'product-analytics' },
    { name: 'onboarding-nps', calculation: 'survey-score', dataSource: 'feedback-system' }
  ]
})
