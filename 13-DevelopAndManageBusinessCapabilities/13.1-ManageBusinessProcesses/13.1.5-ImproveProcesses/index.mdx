# Improve processes

> Business-as-Code definition for continuous process improvement. Models the identification of improvement opportunities, management of improvement projects, and execution of ongoing Lean/Six Sigma and Kaizen activities.

## Overview

Identifying and choosing improvement opportunities. Create and manage improvement projects. Perform the improvement activities continuously and routinely.

```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| identifyImprovementOpportunity | Discover and evaluate potential process improvements from performance data |
| prioritizeOpportunity | Rank improvement opportunities by business impact and feasibility |
| launchImprovementProject | Initiate a formal improvement project with charter and team |
| executeImprovementCycle | Run DMAIC, Kaizen, or other structured improvement cycles |
| validateImprovement | Verify that changes produce the expected performance gains |
| institutionalizeChange | Embed successful improvements into standard operating procedures |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| improvementOpportunityIdentified | Potential process improvement discovered and documented |
| opportunityPrioritized | Improvement opportunity ranked and selected for action |
| improvementProjectLaunched | Improvement project formally initiated with charter and resources |
| improvementCycleExecuted | Structured improvement cycle completed |
| improvementValidated | Performance gains confirmed through statistical validation |
| changeInstitutionalized | Improvement embedded into standard procedures and controls |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findImprovementOpportunities | List identified opportunities filtered by status, impact, or domain |
| getImprovementProjectStatus | Retrieve current status and metrics for an improvement project |
| getImprovementHistory | Retrieve historical improvements for a process |
| findActiveKaizenEvents | List active Kaizen or rapid improvement events |

## Usage

```typescript
import { improveProcesses } from '@headlessly/improve-processes'

const ci = improveProcesses()

// Identify improvement opportunities from performance data
const opportunities = await ci.identifyImprovementOpportunity({
  processId: 'PRC-order-fulfillment',
  criteria: ['cycle-time', 'error-rate'],
  threshold: 'below-target'
})

// Launch an improvement project
const project = await ci.launchImprovementProject({
  opportunityId: opportunities[0].id,
  methodology: 'DMAIC',
  targetImprovement: 0.25,
  teamMembers: ['analyst-01', 'operator-05', 'engineer-03']
})
