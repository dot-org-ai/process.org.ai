# Establish and maintain process tools and templates

> Business-as-Code definition for BPM tool and template lifecycle management. Models the complete process of selecting, configuring, deploying, and maintaining tools and reusable templates that support business process management.

## Overview

Instituting, organizing, and maintaining the upkeep of the techniques used for business process management (BPM). Create and maintain templates of BPM tools that can be readily implemented, including process engine, business analytics, content management, and collaboration tools.

import { establishAndMaintainProcessToolsAndTemplates } from '@headlessly/establish-and-maintain-process-tools-and-templates'

const toolkit = establishAndMaintainProcessToolsAndTemplates()

// Evaluate tool options
const evaluation = await toolkit.evaluateToolOptions({
  category: 'processEngine',
  criteria: ['scalability', 'integration', 'usability'],
  budget: 150000
})

// Create a process template
const template = await toolkit.createProcessTemplate({
  name: 'Standard Order-to-Cash',
  notation: 'BPMN2.0',
  domain: 'finance'
})

// Maintain template library
const update = await toolkit.maintainTemplateLibrary({
  templateId: template.id,
  action: 'publish',
  version: '2.1'
})
```
