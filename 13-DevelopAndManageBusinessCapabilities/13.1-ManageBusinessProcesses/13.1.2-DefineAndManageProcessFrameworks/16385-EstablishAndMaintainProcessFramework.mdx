# Establish and maintain process framework

> Business-as-Code definition for process framework establishment. Models the creation and ongoing maintenance of the enterprise process architecture covering strategy, operations, and management layers.

## Overview

Defining and managing the framework that outlines the required business processes of the organization, key elements, and how they should interact. Institute strategy infrastructure and product, operations, and enterprise management.

## Process Hierarchy

```mermaid

    A[Define and manage process frameworks]
    A --> B[Establish and maintain process framework]
    A --> C[Identify cross-functional processes]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

## GraphDL

```yaml
establish:
  object: And Maintain Process Framework
  actor: ProcessArchitect
  result: ProcessFrameworkDocument
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| defineFrameworkStructure | Create the hierarchical structure of process categories, groups, and levels |
| mapProcessInteractions | Document how processes interact across strategy, operations, and management layers |
| assignProcessOwnership | Designate accountable owners for each process area in the framework |
| validateFrameworkAlignment | Verify framework alignment with organizational strategy and operating model |
| maintainFrameworkVersions | Manage version control and change history for framework updates |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| frameworkStructureDefined | Process framework hierarchy created and approved |
| processInteractionsMapped | Cross-process dependencies and handoffs documented |
| processOwnershipAssigned | Accountable owners designated for all framework processes |
| frameworkAlignmentValidated | Framework confirmed as aligned with organizational strategy |
| frameworkVersionUpdated | New framework version published with documented changes |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getFrameworkVersion | Retrieve the current or historical version of the process framework |
| findProcessByCategory | List processes within a specific framework category or level |
| getProcessOwnership | Retrieve ownership assignments by process area |

## Usage

```typescript
import { establishAndMaintainProcessFramework } from '@headlessly/establish-and-maintain-process-framework'

const framework = establishAndMaintainProcessFramework()

// Define the framework structure
const structure = await framework.defineFrameworkStructure({
  categories: ['strategy', 'operations', 'management'],
  levels: ['category', 'process-group', 'process', 'activity'],
  standard: 'APQC-PCF-v7.4'
})

// Assign process ownership
const assignment = await framework.assignProcessOwnership({
  processId: 'PRC-order-to-cash',
  ownerId: 'EMP-VP-operations',
  effectiveDate: '2026-01-15'
})
```
