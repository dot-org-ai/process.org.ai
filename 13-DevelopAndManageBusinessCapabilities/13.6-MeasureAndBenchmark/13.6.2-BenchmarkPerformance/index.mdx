# Benchmark performance

> Business-as-Code definition for performance benchmarking. Models the assessment of organizational performance, development of benchmarking capabilities, execution of internal and external comparisons, gap analysis, and establishment of change needs.

## Overview

Comparing organizational performance internally or externally with other organizations.

  metrics: ['cycle-time', 'cost-per-invoice', 'automation-rate'],
  comparatorSet: 'APQC-cross-industry',
  targetPercentile: 'top-quartile'
})

// Conduct gap analysis
const gaps = await benchmark.conductGapAnalysis({
  benchmarkId: results.id,
  significanceThreshold: 0.15
})
