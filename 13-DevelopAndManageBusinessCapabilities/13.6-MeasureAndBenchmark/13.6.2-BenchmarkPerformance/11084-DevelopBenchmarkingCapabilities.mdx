# Develop benchmarking capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for develop benchmarking capabilities. Models the process of improving an organization's ability to compare its performance internally or externally, and maintaining benchmarking relationships with other organizations.

## Overview

Improving an organization's ability to compare its performance internally or externally, and maintaining benchmarking relationships with other organizations. Train staff in benchmarking. Develop technological solutions or other materials to aid benchmarking efforts. Consult with external entities to gain knowledge or tools to help benchmark.
