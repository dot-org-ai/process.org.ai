# Evaluate process performance

> Business-as-Code definition for process performance evaluation. Models the end-to-end cycle of establishing metrics, collecting data, calculating measures, identifying trends, analyzing against benchmarks, reporting, and developing improvement plans.

## Overview

Assessing process data, measures, and trends in an effort to evaluate process performance and identify possible improvements.
