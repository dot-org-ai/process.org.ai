# Analyze performance against benchmark data

> Business-as-Code definition for analyze performance against benchmark data. Models the process of evaluating the gaps between achieved and benchmarked performance.

## Overview

Evaluating the gaps between achieved and benchmarked performance. Analyze how performance differs from the optimal or expected performance.
