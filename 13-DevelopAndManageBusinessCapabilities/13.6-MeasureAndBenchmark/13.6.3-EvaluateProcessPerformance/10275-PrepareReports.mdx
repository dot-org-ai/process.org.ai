# Prepare reports

> Business-as-Code definition for prepare reports. Models the process of creating reports that systematically record and represent the performance planning.

## Overview

Creating reports that systematically record and represent the performance planning. Construct a detailed report specifying the performance, and include indicators such as the performance gaps, performance trends, and analysis.

})

// Gather performance data for reports
const assessment = await client.collectData({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Compute performance measures for reports
await client.calculatePerformance({
  resultId: result.id,
  format: 'detailed',
  recipients: ['stakeholders']
})
