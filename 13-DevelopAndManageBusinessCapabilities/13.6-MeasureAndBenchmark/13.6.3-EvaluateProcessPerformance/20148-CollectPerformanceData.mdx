const client = collectPerformanceData()

// Establish measurement criteria and indicators for performance data
const result = await client.defineMetrics({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Gather performance data for performance data
const assessment = await client.collectData({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Compute performance measures for performance data
await client.calculatePerformance({
  resultId: result.id,
  format: 'detailed',
  recipients: ['stakeholders']
})
```
