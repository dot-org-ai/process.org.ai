# Create enterprise measurement systems model

> Business-as-Code definition for create enterprise measurement systems model. Models the process of developing a model for organization's management systems.

## Overview

Developing a model for organization's management systems. Develop a high-level measurement system to track performance across the enterprise or in specific functions or business units. Determine which processes to measure, which measures to use, how often to measure, and measurement targets. Review strategic decisions about how to best measure an organization.
