# Measure process efficiency

> Business-as-Code definition for measure process efficiency. Models the process of evaluating the efficiency of the organization's processes.

## Overview

Evaluating the efficiency of the organization's processes. Adapt evaluation to the activities and business components being measured. (Unlike process Measure staff productivity [11078], process Measures outcomes [11076] [e.g., how much of X is produced within X time period].) Measure a manufacturing process, for example, according to number of units produced per FTE or number of "high quality" units produced.

const client = measureProcessEfficiency()

// Establish measurement criteria and indicators for process efficiency
const result = await client.defineMetrics({

  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Gather performance data for process efficiency
const assessment = await client.collectData({
