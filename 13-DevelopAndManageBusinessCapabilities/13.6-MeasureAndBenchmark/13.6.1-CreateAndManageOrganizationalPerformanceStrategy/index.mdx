# Create and manage organizational performance strategy

> Business-as-Code definition for organizational performance strategy. Models the creation of enterprise measurement systems and the systematic measurement of process efficiency, cost effectiveness, staff productivity, and cycle time.

## Overview

Creating and implementing a strategy for administering organizational performance. This process element calls upon the organization to create and administer a strategy for measuring, tracking, streamlining, and improving internal performance. It encompasses creating a blueprint for the tactical measurement of internal processes and work force improvement, in alignment with Employee Metrics Developed and Managed [10526].

// Create enterprise measurement model
const model = await perfStrategy.createMeasurementModel({
  strategicObjectives: ['revenue-growth', 'operational-excellence', 'customer-satisfaction'],
  perspectives: ['financial', 'customer', 'process', 'learning']
})

// Measure cycle time for order fulfillment
const cycleTime = await perfStrategy.measureCycleTime({
  processId: 'PRC-order-fulfillment',
