# Measure and benchmark

> Business-as-Code definition for organizational measurement and benchmarking. Models the complete performance management cycle from metric design and data collection through internal and external benchmarking to gap analysis and improvement planning.

## Overview

Creating and administering a strategy to manage organizational performance. Benchmark the performance of the internal processes, as well as the organization as a whole.

## Usage

```typescript
import { measureAndBenchmark } from '@headlessly/measure-and-benchmark'

const perf = measureAndBenchmark()

// Conduct an external benchmark for order-to-cash cycle time
const benchmark = await perf.conductBenchmark({
  process: 'order-to-cash',
  metric: 'cycle-time',
  comparatorSet: 'industry-median',
  industry: 'manufacturing'
})

// Analyze gaps against benchmark targets
const gaps = await perf.analyzeGaps({
  benchmarkId: benchmark.id,
  threshold: 0.1
})
```
