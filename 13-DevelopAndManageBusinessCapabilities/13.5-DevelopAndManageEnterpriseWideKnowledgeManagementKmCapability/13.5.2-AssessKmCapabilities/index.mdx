> Business-as-Code definition for KM capability assessment. Models the evaluation of existing KM initiative maturity, review of current approaches, and identification of gaps and needs for improvement.

## Overview

Assessing the maturity of the existing initiatives in knowledge management, and evaluating existing KM approaches. Identify the gaps and needs in order to enhance the existing KM approaches. Develop and implement new KM approaches.

const maturity = await assess.assessMaturity({
  framework: 'APQC-KM-Maturity',
  departments: ['engineering', 'sales', 'operations'],
  dimensions: ['people', 'process', 'technology', 'governance']
})

// Identify capability gaps
const gaps = await assess.identifyGaps({
  assessmentId: maturity.id,
  threshold: 'level-3-target'
})
