```typescript
import { developNewKmApproaches } from '@headlessly/develop-new-km-approaches'

const km = developNewKmApproaches()

// Assess knowledge needs across engineering teams
const needs = await km.assessKnowledgeNeeds({
  scope: 'Engineering',
  domains: ['incident-response', 'architecture-decisions', 'onboarding'],
  methodology: 'knowledge-audit'
})

// Design a knowledge solution for the highest-priority gap
const solution = await km.designKnowledgeSolution({
  needsAssessmentId: needs.id,
  approachType: 'community-of-practice',
  platform: 'confluence-wiki',
  governanceModel: 'federated'
})

// Deploy the knowledge capability
const deployment = await km.deployKnowledgeCapability({
  solutionId: solution.id,
  pilotGroup: 'engineering-platform-team',
  rolloutPhases: ['pilot', 'early-adopters', 'general-availability'],
  trainingRequired: true
})
