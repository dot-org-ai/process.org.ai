# Design and implement KM capabilities

> Business-as-Code definition for KM capability design and implementation. Models the development of new KM approaches, resource modeling, technology enablement, deployment, and measurement of knowledge management systems.

## Overview

Creating knowledge bases and other repositories to preserve and develop company expertise, and to train new employees.

```typescript
import { designAndImplementKMCapabilities } from '@headlessly/design-and-implement-km-capabilities'

const kmImpl = designAndImplementKMCapabilities()

// Develop a new KM approach for engineering best practices
const approach = await kmImpl.developNewApproach({
  domain: 'engineering-best-practices',
  type: 'community-of-practice',
  targetUsers: ['software-engineers', 'architects', 'tech-leads']
})

// Implement the new approach
const deployment = await kmImpl.implementApproach({
  approachId: approach.id,
  rolloutPhases: ['pilot', 'department', 'enterprise'],
  pilotGroup: 'platform-engineering'
})
