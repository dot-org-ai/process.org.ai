# Implement new KM approaches

> Business-as-Code definition for implement new km approaches. Models the process of implementing new policies, procedures, and guidelines to support knowledge management.

## Overview

Implementing new policies, procedures, and guidelines to support knowledge management across the enterprise. This includes deploying new knowledge sharing platforms, communities of practice, taxonomies, and content governance frameworks. The process covers pilot testing of KM approaches with select business units, training knowledge contributors and consumers, integrating KM tools with existing workflows, and establishing feedback mechanisms to refine the approach before full-scale rollout.
