# Sustain improvement

> Business-as-Code definition for improvement sustainment. Models the ongoing monitoring of reengineered processes, capture and reuse of lessons learned, and execution of corrective actions to ensure change benefits persist.

## Overview

Sustaining the impact of the change process in order to enact continual process improvement. Monitor the performance of re-engineered business processes. Identify best practices and potential issues. Effectuate remedial steps.

## GraphDL

```yaml
sustain:
  object: Improvement
  actor: ContinuousImprovementLead
  result: SustainmentReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| monitorImprovedPerformance | Track KPIs of reengineered processes against expected performance levels |
| captureLessonsLearned | Document insights, best practices, and pitfalls from the change process |
| takeCorrectiveAction | Implement remedial steps when improved processes regress or underperform |
| reinforceNewBehaviors | Sustain adoption through ongoing recognition and reinforcement activities |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| improvedPerformanceMonitored | Post-change process performance data collected and reviewed |
| lessonsLearnedCaptured | Change process retrospective completed and insights documented |
| correctiveActionTaken | Remedial action executed to address performance regression |
| newBehaviorsReinforced | Adoption reinforcement activities completed |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| getPostChangeMetrics | Retrieve performance metrics for processes after change implementation |
| findLessonsLearned | List documented lessons learned by initiative or topic |
| getCorrectiveActions | Retrieve open corrective actions for sustained improvements |

## Usage

```typescript
import { sustainImprovement } from '@headlessly/sustain-improvement'

const sustain = sustainImprovement()

// Monitor post-change process performance
const metrics = await sustain.monitorImprovedPerformance({
  initiativeId: 'CHG-2026-015',
  processes: ['order-to-cash', 'procurement-cycle'],
  baselinePeriod: '2025-Q4',
  currentPeriod: '2026-Q2'
})

// Capture lessons learned
const lessons = await sustain.captureLessonsLearned({
  initiativeId: 'CHG-2026-015',
  categories: ['what-worked', 'what-did-not', 'recommendations'],
  participants: ['change-team', 'process-owners', 'champions']
