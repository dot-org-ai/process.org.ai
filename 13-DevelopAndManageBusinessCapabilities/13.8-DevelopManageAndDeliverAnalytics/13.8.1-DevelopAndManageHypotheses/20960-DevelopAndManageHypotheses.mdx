# Develop and manage hypotheses

> Business-as-Code definition for develop and manage hypotheses. Models the process of creating theories that explain empirical data.

## Overview

Creating theories that explain empirical data. Use the hypotheses to guide feature selection in the process of data collection.

const client = developAndManageHypotheses()

// Develop analytical hypothesis for manage hypotheses
const result = await client.formulateHypothesis({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Collect and prepare data for manage hypotheses
const assessment = await client.gatherData({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Execute analytical methods for manage hypotheses
await client.performAnalysis({
  resultId: result.id,
