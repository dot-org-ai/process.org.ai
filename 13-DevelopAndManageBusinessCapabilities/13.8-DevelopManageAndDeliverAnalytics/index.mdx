const analytics = developManageAndDeliverAnalytics()

// Formulate a hypothesis about customer churn
const hypothesis = await analytics.formulateHypothesis({
  domain: 'customer-retention',
  statement: 'Customers with fewer than 3 support interactions in 90 days have higher churn',
  expectedOutcome: 'churn-rate-correlation'
})

// Run analysis on the prepared dataset
const results = await analytics.runAnalysis({
  hypothesisId: hypothesis.id,
  algorithm: 'logistic-regression',
  datasetId: 'DS-2026-CRM-Q1'
})
