# Manage non-conformance

> Business-as-Code definition for non-conformance management. Models the complete CAPA lifecycle from impact assessment and containment through root cause analysis, corrective and preventive action implementation, and formal closure.

## Overview

Handling any nonconformance activities or events. Assess the potential impact of the nonconformity. Decide the immediate actions to take. Identify the root causes. Take corrective or preventive action. Ensure future conformance.

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| assessImpact | Evaluate the severity, scope, and potential consequences of a non-conformance |
| containNonConformance | Implement immediate containment actions to prevent further impact |
| performRootCauseAnalysis | Investigate underlying causes using methods such as 5-Why or fishbone analysis |
| implementCorrectiveAction | Execute corrective actions to eliminate the root cause |
| implementPreventiveAction | Deploy preventive measures to avoid recurrence |
| verifyEffectiveness | Confirm that corrective and preventive actions resolved the issue |
| closeNonConformance | Complete formal closure with documentation and lessons learned |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| impactAssessed | Non-conformance severity and scope evaluation completed |
| nonConformanceContained | Immediate containment actions executed |
| rootCauseIdentified | Root cause analysis completed with findings documented |
| correctiveActionImplemented | Corrective action executed and evidence collected |
| preventiveActionImplemented | Preventive measure deployed to avoid recurrence |
| effectivenessVerified | CAPA effectiveness confirmed through follow-up verification |
| nonConformanceClosed | Non-conformance record formally closed and archived |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findNonConformances | List non-conformance records filtered by severity, status, or source |
| getRootCauseAnalysis | Retrieve the root cause analysis for a specific non-conformance |
| findOpenCAPAs | List open corrective and preventive actions by due date or owner |
| getNonConformanceTrends | Retrieve trend data for non-conformance occurrence by category |

## Sub-Processes

| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| 13.3.3.1 | Assess potential impact | Analyzing any nonconformance events. Determine the need for corrective and/or preventative action(s) |
| 13.3.3.2 | Determine immediate action(s) | Initiating immediate corrective, preventative, or no action based upon the impact and likelihood of  |
| 13.3.3.3 | Identify root cause(s) | Recognizing the reasons that have triggered the nonconformance events or activities. Perform a root- |
| 13.3.3.4 | Take corrective or preventative action | Pursuing corrective and preventative activities to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity.  |
| 13.3.3.5 | Close non-conformance | Closing nonconformance. Perform all the final processes related to the nonconformance, including doc |

## Related Processes

| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| 13.3.2 Evaluate performance to requirements | Upstream - test failures generate non-conformance records |
| 13.3.1 Establish quality requirements | Upstream - requirements define conformance criteria |
| 13.3.4 Implement and maintain the EQMS | Parallel - non-conformance data feeds EQMS performance tracking |

| Department | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Quality Assurance | Primary owner of non-conformance investigation and CAPA |
| Engineering | Provides technical expertise for root cause analysis |
| Operations | Implements containment and corrective actions on the floor |

## Usage

```typescript
import { manageNonConformance } from '@headlessly/manage-non-conformance'

const ncr = manageNonConformance()

// Assess the impact of a non-conformance
const impact = await ncr.assessImpact({
  nonConformanceId: 'NCR-2026-0089',
  source: 'incoming-inspection',
  description: 'Supplier batch fails dimensional tolerance check',
  affectedQuantity: 500
})

// Perform root cause analysis
const rca = await ncr.performRootCauseAnalysis({
  nonConformanceId: 'NCR-2026-0089',
  method: 'five-why',
  team: ['quality-engineer', 'supplier-quality', 'process-engineer']
