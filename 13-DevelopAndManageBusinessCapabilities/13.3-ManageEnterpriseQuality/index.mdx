# Manage enterprise quality

> Business-as-Code definition for enterprise quality management. Models the complete quality lifecycle from requirements definition and control planning through testing, non-conformance resolution, and continuous EQMS governance.

## Overview

Managing organizational attributes that are closely associated with the quality of output. Determine the quality requirements. Evaluate the correspondence between the quality performance and requirements. Manage non-conformance activities. Ensure implementation and maintenance of the enterprise quality management system.

const quality = manageEnterpriseQuality()

// Define quality standards for a product line
const standards = await quality.defineQualityStandards({
  productLine: 'industrial-sensors',
  characteristics: ['accuracy', 'durability', 'response-time'],
  acceptanceCriteria: { accuracy: { tolerance: 0.01, unit: 'mm' } }
})

// Raise a non-conformance event
const ncr = await quality.raiseNonConformance({
  source: 'incoming-inspection',
  severity: 'major',
  description: 'Batch 4421 sensor calibration out of tolerance'
})
```
