# Establish quality requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for quality requirements establishment. Models the process of defining critical-to-quality characteristics, preventive activities, control plans, capability validation, and quality plan finalization.

## Overview

Determining essential activities, processes, and attributes for securing enterprise quality. Outline critical characteristics for quality. Outline activities encouraging the preservation of quality. Create quality controls. Confirm capabilities in accordance with quality requirements. Finalize the plan for quality maintenance.

const quality = establishQualityRequirements()

// Define critical-to-quality characteristics
const ctq = await quality.defineCTQCharacteristics({
  productId: 'PROD-sensor-v3',
  customerNeeds: ['precision', 'reliability', 'fast-response'],
  specifications: [
    { characteristic: 'accuracy', target: 0.01, unit: 'mm', tolerance: 0.005 }
  ]
})

// Validate measurement capability
const capability = await quality.validateCapability({
