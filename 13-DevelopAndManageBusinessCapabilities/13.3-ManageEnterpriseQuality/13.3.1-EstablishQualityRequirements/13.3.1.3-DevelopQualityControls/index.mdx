# Develop quality controls

> Business-as-Code definition for quality control development. Models the design of control points, sampling plans, measurement methods, and competency requirements for enterprise quality assurance.

## Overview

Developing controls for managing the quality of enterprise. Define the process steps for quality controls and the sampling plan. Identify the tools and methods to measure quality. Define the competencies required.

```typescript
import { developQualityControls } from '@headlessly/develop-quality-controls'

const controls = developQualityControls()

// Define control points for a manufacturing process
const controlPlan = await controls.defineControlPoints({
  processId: 'PRC-circuit-board-assembly',
  stages: ['incoming-materials', 'solder-application', 'component-placement', 'final-test'],
  controlType: 'in-process'
})

// Design a sampling plan for incoming inspection
const samplingPlan = await controls.designSamplingPlan({
  controlPointId: controlPlan.points[0].id,
  standard: 'ANSI-ASQ-Z1.4',
  inspectionLevel: 'II',
  aql: 1.0
})
