# Define process steps for controls (or integration points)

> Business-as-Code definition for define process steps for controls (or integration points). Models the process of establishing the steps for developing quality controls.

## Overview

Establishing the steps for developing quality controls. Conduct Alpha testing. Have the product team conduct rework. Send the product/service for Beta testing, and carry on rework as needed.

const client = defineProcessStepsForControlsOrIntegrationPoints()

// Establish measurable quality criteria for process steps for controls (or integration points)
const result = await client.defineQualityCriteria({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Perform quality inspection or test for process steps for controls (or integration points)
const assessment = await client.executeQualityCheck({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Evaluate quality data and identify trends for process steps for controls (or integration points)
await client.analyzeResults({
  resultId: result.id,
  format: 'detailed',
