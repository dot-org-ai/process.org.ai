# Assess results of tests

> Business-as-Code definition for quality test result assessment. Models the statistical evaluation of sample significance, result summarization, improvement recommendation, and next-step decision-making.

## Overview

Assessing the significance of the sample. Summarize the results of the test. Recommend improvement actions. Decide what steps to take next.
