# Test against quality plan

> Business-as-Code definition for quality plan testing. Models the execution of quality tests, data collection, result recording, and disposition determination against established quality standards.

## Overview

Examining the quality of organizational processes. Conduct tests. Collect information and data. Record the results of these tests. Determine the dispositions of the test results.

## Usage

```typescript
import { testAgainstQualityPlan } from '@headlessly/test-against-quality-plan'

const testing = testAgainstQualityPlan()

// Execute a quality test for a production batch
const result = await testing.executeQualityTest({
  qualityPlanId: 'QP-2026-PCB-assembly',
  batchId: 'BATCH-20260115-A',
  controlPoint: 'final-electrical-test',
  sampleSize: 13
})

// Determine disposition based on results
const disposition = await testing.determineDisposition({
  testResultId: result.id,
  failureCount: result.failures,
  acceptanceCriteria: 'ANSI-ASQ-Z1.4-AQL-1.0'
})
