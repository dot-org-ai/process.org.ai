# Conduct test and collect data

> Business-as-Code definition for conduct test and collect data. Models the process of evaluating quality performance through periodic or episodic testing against the established standards for quality characteristics.

## Overview

Evaluating quality performance through periodic or episodic testing against the established standards for quality characteristics. For periodic testing, design a schedule with sufficient time to make any required adjustments to the process or system to maintain the desired level of quality. For episodic testing, conduct a test whenever a known non-conformance or fault occurs, which results in outputs or outcomes known to be unsatisfactory to performance requirements.

const client = conductTestAndCollectData()

// Establish measurable quality criteria for test and collect data
const result = await client.defineQualityCriteria({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Perform quality inspection or test for test and collect data
const assessment = await client.executeQualityCheck({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Evaluate quality data and identify trends for test and collect data
await client.analyzeResults({
  resultId: result.id,
  format: 'detailed',
