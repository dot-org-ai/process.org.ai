# Evaluate performance to requirements

> Business-as-Code definition for quality performance evaluation. Models the testing of deliverables against quality plans, statistical assessment of test results, and determination of corrective actions based on conformance findings.

## Overview

Analyzing if the performance of the quality plan has achieved the estimated and desired requirements. Conduct tests against the quality plan. Assess the results of these tests.

```

## GraphDL

```yaml
evaluate:
  object: Performance To Requirements
  actor: QualityInspector
  result: TestAssessmentReport
```

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| conductTest | Execute quality tests according to the sampling plan and collect data |
| recordTestResult | Document test outcomes including measurements and observations |
| determineDisposition | Classify test results as pass, fail, or conditional |
| assessSampleSignificance | Evaluate the statistical significance of test samples |
| summarizeResults | Aggregate and summarize test outcomes for reporting |
| recommendActions | Propose corrective or preventive actions based on test findings |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| testConducted | Quality test executed and raw data collected |
| testResultRecorded | Test outcome documented in the quality system |
| dispositionDetermined | Test result classified and disposition assigned |
| sampleSignificanceAssessed | Statistical analysis of sample data completed |
| resultsSummarized | Test outcomes aggregated and summary report generated |
| actionsRecommended | Corrective or preventive actions proposed to stakeholders |

## Searches

| Search | Description |

  batchId: 'BATCH-4421',
  sampleSize: 25,
  characteristics: ['accuracy', 'response-time']
})

// Assess sample significance
const assessment = await evaluation.assessSampleSignificance({
