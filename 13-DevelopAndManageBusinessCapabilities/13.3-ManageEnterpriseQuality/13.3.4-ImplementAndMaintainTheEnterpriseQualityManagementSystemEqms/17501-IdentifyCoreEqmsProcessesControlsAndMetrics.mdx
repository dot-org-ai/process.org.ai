# Identify core EQMS processes, controls, and metrics

> Business-as-Code definition for identify core eqms processes, controls, and metrics. Models the process of recognizing and implementing the processes, controls, and metrics for maintenance of eqms.

## Overview

Recognizing and implementing the processes, controls, and metrics for maintenance of EQMS. Define the role of EQMS in failure mode and effects analysis, complaint handling, and advanced product quality planning. Establish the role of EQMS in evaluating metrics such as cost of quality, overall equipment effectiveness, on-time and complete shipments, percentage of products in compliance, and new product introductions.

// Establish measurable quality criteria for core eqms processes, controls, and metrics
const result = await client.defineQualityCriteria({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Perform quality inspection or test for core eqms processes, controls, and metrics
const assessment = await client.executeQualityCheck({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Evaluate quality data and identify trends for core eqms processes, controls, and metrics
await client.analyzeResults({
  resultId: result.id,
