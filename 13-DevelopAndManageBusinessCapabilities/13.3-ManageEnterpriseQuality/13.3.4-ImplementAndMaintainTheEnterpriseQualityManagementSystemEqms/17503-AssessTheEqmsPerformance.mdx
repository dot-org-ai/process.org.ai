# Assess the EQMS performance

> Business-as-Code definition for assess the eqms performance. Models the process of benchmarking current performance in quality metrics that span across the value chain.

## Overview

Benchmarking current performance in quality metrics that span across the value chain. Identify gaps in performance as compared to industry peers. Identify and implement complementary EQMS capabilities. Enable a continuous improvement environment.

const client = assessTheEqmsPerformance()

// Establish measurable quality criteria for eqms performance
const result = await client.defineQualityCriteria({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Perform quality inspection or test for eqms performance
const assessment = await client.executeQualityCheck({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Evaluate quality data and identify trends for eqms performance
await client.analyzeResults({
  resultId: result.id,
  format: 'detailed',
  recipients: ['stakeholders']
