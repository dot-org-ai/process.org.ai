# Plan and deploy the EQMS scope, targets, and goals

> Business-as-Code definition for plan and deploy the eqms scope, targets, and goals. Models the process of establishing and effectively deploying the scope, targets, and goals of eqms.

## Overview

Establishing and effectively deploying the scope, targets, and goals of EQMS. Define the role of EQMS through nonconformance/corrective and preventive action, compliance/audit management, risk management, failure mode and effects analysis, and statistical process control. Implement EQMS into operational activities. Define the goals and objectives that are to be achieved by the EQMS.

// Establish measurable quality criteria for deploy eqms scope, targets, and goals
const result = await client.defineQualityCriteria({
  scope: 'enterprise',
  period: 'Q1-2025'
})

// Perform quality inspection or test for deploy eqms scope, targets, and goals
const assessment = await client.executeQualityCheck({
  resultId: result.id,
  criteria: 'standard'
})

// Evaluate quality data and identify trends for deploy eqms scope, targets, and goals
await client.analyzeResults({
  resultId: result.id,
